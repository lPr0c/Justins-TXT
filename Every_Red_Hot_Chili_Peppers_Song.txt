Baby Appeal - Red Hot Chili Peppers - 1984

[Chorus 1]
On the city streets, I got the tunes in my pocket
I'll play the Chili Pepper so the public can rock it
Excuse me mister, won't you hear my thought?
I play in a band, yeah, we're called the Red Hots
While I'm away, boy, I'm afraid not
I've got no time to flick and talk
But this baby rocked out on the spot
She was a shaking and a kicking and that did a bit of tot
Her pop said no, but I just couldn't stop
The kid had a case of toddler rock
[Chorus 2]
But here's a funky fact that I know is real
The Red Hots have baby appeal
They dig a funky spiel, it makes them squeal
I say the Peppers have baby appeal
The funk mobile is the one we wheel
I'm overjoyed, we have baby appeal
We serve those tots in the funk mobile
I'm overjoyed, we have baby appeal

[Verse]
We stop the fire, we quench the heat
We groove the buttocks walking out in the street
Because that's when in the store when who do we meet?
On a hop skip jump up a baby beat
She was a shaking and a kicking those itty bitty feet
The next thing you know was she got out of her bleat
Five thousand babies walking out in the street
Well, that's a serious sight for me and golly gee wizz!
I just can't tell you how much we did

Rocking right out for those itty bitty girls, right out

[Chorus 2]
But here's a funky fact that I know is real
The Red Hots have baby appeal
They dig a funky spiel, it makes them squeal
I say the Peppers have baby appeal
The funk mobile is the one we wheel
I'm overjoyed, we have baby appeal
We serve those tots in the funk mobile
I'm overjoyed, we have baby appeal, so get down!

[Bridge]
Got the tunes in my pocket
Baby appeal
Rock out!
Play the chili, play the chili, play the chili
Yes, we're called the Red...Hots

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
But here's a funky fact that I know is real
The Red Hots have baby appeal

I'm overjoyed, we have baby appeal
We serve those tots in the funk mobile
I'm overjoyed, we have baby appeal

Hah, on the ice, no holding my soul
I want men, not mice, no stopping my throw
Hah, get this, reds are back bills
Work or play ball or just turn me loose

[Chorus 2]
I know what's right, in life, you better buckle down
Don't give up your fight, in life, you better buckle down
Two days with might, in life, you better buckle down
Leave dreams tonight, in life, you better buckle down

Why Don't You Love Me - Red Hot Chili Peppers - 1984

[Chorus 1]
Why don't you love me like you used to do?
How come you treat me like a worn out shoe?
My hair's still curly and my eyes are still blue
So why don't you love me like you used to do?

[Chorus 2]
Why don't you spot me like you used to do?
When you whisper sweet nothings like you used to do
I'm the same old trouble that you've always been through
So why don't you love me like you used to do?

[Chorus 3]
Oh, why don't you be the way you used to be?
How come you fight so many fights with me?
Somebody changed, so let me give you a clue
Why don't you love me like you used to do?

[Chorus 4]
Why don't you say the things you used to say?
How come you treat me like a piece of clay?
My hair's still curly and my eyes are still blue
So why don't you love me like you used to do?

[Chorus 5]
You can't keep a loving and a hugging and a kissing and I don't know why
We don't get near or further, closer, land of country mouths
I don't love like a hugging and a kissing and I don't know why
We don't get near or further, closer, land of country mouths, take the ball

We don't get near or further, closer, land of country mouths



Green Heaven - Red Hot Chili Peppers - 1984

[Verse 1]
About this planet, there is something I know
There's a very big difference between above and below
A friend, foe, or bro, leave your body on the floor
Let your spirit fly away like the soul of a crow
Here, above land, man has laid his plan
And yes, it does include the Ku Klux Klan
We got a government so twisted and bent
Bombs, tanks and guns is how our money is spent
We got V.D., heroin, greed and prostitution
Tension, aggravation, L. Ron Hubbard solution
Not to mention hard-core chemical pollution
If you think a different way, you're in a mental institution
And that's a heart felt shame
'Cause everyone's crazy, everyone's the same
So, why should only Larry, Curly and Moe be to blame?

[Bridge]
Wow
Ow, ow, ow
Ooh

[Verse 2]
Time now take you to a different place
Where peace-loving whales flow through liquid outer space
A grooving and a gliding as graceful as lace
A never-losing touch with ocean's embrace
Diviner than the dolphin, that there is none
'Cause dolphins just-a like to have a lot of fun
No one tells 'em how their life is run
And no one points at 'em with a gun
They have a lot of love for every livin' creature
The smile of a dolphin is a built-in feature
They be movin' in schools but everyone's the teacher
Someday mister dolphin, I know I'm going to meet ya

[Verse 3]
Back to the land of the police man
Where he does whatever he says he can
Including hating you because you're a Jew
Or beating black ass, that's nothing new
A trigger-happy cops, they just like to brawl
They use guns, clubs, gas, but that's not all
They got puke-ridden prisons and sex-sick jails
Fuck the poor, if you're rich you pay the bail
So support your police, support your local wars
That's the way to open economic doors
Why do we do it? 'Cause the president's a whore
We assume the position to sell the ammunition
What the fuck? It's the American tradition
Along with goin' fishin', apple pies in the kitchen
Isn't it bitchin' seeing dead men in ditches?

Out In L.A. - Red Hot Chili Peppers - 1984

[Intro]
We're all a bunch of brothers living in a cool way
Along with six million others in this place called LA

[Verse 1]
LA is the place, sets my mind ablaze
For me, it's a race through a cotton-picking maze
The town makes me jump, it's got a bunch of bad chicks
Well sure, it's got some chumps, but I still get my kicks
My body loves to scrump when I lick the ripe pick
Alike dump on a thumb
Pop hump, hump, hump, pop out
The action never stops, I'm as wild as can be
Because I'm shooting for the top, and my best friend's a Flea
Oom Chucka Willy knew the balls to pop
But he never met the Tree, so he never be-bopped out hop!

[Verse 2]
Antoine the Swan, from the pretty fish pond
Was a bad mother jumper, you could tell he was strong
Wore a cold paisley jacket and a hella fine ass
In between his legs was a sweet young lass
Threw a hundred women up against the wall
And he swore to fear that he'd love them all
By the time he got to ninety-nine, he had to stop
'Cause that's when he thought that he heard a phone

[Bridge]
Last night and the night before
I heard a fop outside, then I
Came indoors! Rock out!

[Verse 3]
Now that I told ya somethin' about the Flea
Somethin' 'bout the Tree
A little somethin' 'bout me
I can't leave you hanging 'bout my man Sherm Zee
He swings the yang, he bangs the yang
And now, it's time to hear him do his thang
You better be burnin' Sherman!

[Outro]
We're all a bunch of brothers living in a cool way
Along with six million others in this place called LA
Step out!

Jungle Man - Freaky Styley - 1985

[Verse 1]
Deep inside the soul hole
Of Mother Earth
Father Time came
With a supersonic supersonic burst
His soul monkey sperm tribes
Racing to be first
Her ruby fruit jungle
Givin' bush baby bush baby birth
The baby was a boy
But I think what stunned her
Is that this bare breasted baby
Was a baby boy boy boy boy wonder
Crackin' from his thumb bone
Came thelonious thunder
Fill the sky with hellfire
From way down down down under

[Chorus]
I am a jungle man
I am a jungle man
I am a jungle man
I get all the bush I can

[Verse 2]
Erupting from the ground
In Hollywood he glowed
His jungle turned to concrete
His funk bone bone bone bone to stone
Like a full blown volcano
I must let it be known
That through this boy's vein
Atomic lava blood flows and flows
His soul shocking sounds
They make the mountains moan
This boy's become a man
It's time to take take take
Take the throne



Hollywood (Africa) - Freaky Styley - 1985

[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
Well all right, take me back, hold my hand
All the way back to the brotherland
Take me back, I want to go back, oh
Take me back with my funky ass band
All the way back to the brotherland
Take me back, let's go

[Chorus]
I want to go as fast as I can
Slidin' on back to the brotherland
Now children, take me on back
Take me on back, take me on back
Take me on back (East L.A.)
Hollywood

[Verse 2]
I want to get up and go with my funky ass jams
All the way back to the brotherland
Take me back, take me back
I want to go back

Where the woman is the woman
And the man is the man

I want to go as fast as I can
Slidin' on back to the brotherland
Now children



American Ghost Dance - Freaky Styley - 1985

[Verse 1]
Oh give me a home
Where the buffalo roam
And the death of a race is a game
Where seldom is heard
A peaceable word
From the white trash
Who killed as they came
Though these words dig deep
They offer no relief
God save the queen
I am an Indian chief
There is a secret I keep
It's called the talking leaf
And you better believe
That he speaks his beliefs
Like a rock that bleeds
A sea of grief
My talking leaf speaks of
A wounded knee creek

[Chorus]
American ghost dance

[Verse 2]
A new man who is with old ways
He walks the streets of life
But he's in chains
I'm alive he cried
I can feel the flame
Burning red inside
I am an Indian brave
There is a memory
That lives in my blood
Of the brand you laid
On all you touched
But the burning flame
Turns to burning pain
Genuine genocide
And that's truly insane
So like a wild hurricane
I will dance on the grave
Of my race that died
When it should have been saved

[Chorus]
American Ghost Dance!

[Verse 1 again]
Oh give me a home
Where the buffalo roam
And the death of a race is a game
Where seldom is heard
A peaceable word
From the white trash
Who killed as they came
Though these words dig deep
They offer no relief
God save the queen
I am an Indian chief
There is a secret I keep
It's called the talking leaf
And you better believe
That he speaks his beliefs
Like a rock that bleeds
A sea of grief
My talking leaf speaks of
A wounded knee creek

[Chorus]
American ghost dance

[Verse 1]
Give it up to this planet full of strife
We're the brothers cup cuttin' sharp as a knife
With the pop of a snap and the flip of a flap
The cups went up like a natural fact

It was our shoulder space
That made the perfect place
For the magic of the cup
To style out with grace
With a tight turn twist
And a slight swerve swank
The brothers cup kissed
With a kick ass clank

Love all the misses
And love all the misters
Don't be shy when you're sharin' your kisses
The brothers cup kiss
And we ain't sissies

[Verse 3]
It is our notion that the perfect peace potion
Can be found in the wake of the green sea's motion
The long rocking swell of the mighty blue ocean
Is the cradle of peace it's the perfect peace potion

Give it up to this planet full of strife
We're the brothers cup cuttin' sharp as a knife

With the power of the cup we are about to astound
All your preconceptions they will come unbound
We are the brothers cup coming to your town
Bringing tubs of love we're going to spread it around

[Chorus]
We are the brothers cup

We are the brothers cup
We like to get it up

[Chorus]
Catholic school girls rule
Catholic school girls rule
Catholic school girls rule

[Verse 1]
In the class she's taking notes
Just how deep deep is my throat
Mother Mary don't you know

From the cross she's raised her head
This is what the sister said
Give no love until you're wed
Live no life until you're dead
The good books says we must suppress
The good books says we must confess
But who cares what the good books says
Cause now she's taking off her dress

We are pure divine creation
Talking about my generation
Injected with the seed of emasculation
Catholic!



Sex Rap - Freaky Styley - 1985

[Verse]
Time to swing a little melody
To make you all feel something sexually
And now we're going to get it on in the groove
The groove that makes those smooth hips move
We are pumping that driving bad rhythm
To make those pretty little pussy lips schism
Kissum kissum kissum
In the mind is one design
To make you feel fine
Sucking on mine with a 69
I'm inclined to fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck your brains out
For the moment, come on now, make her shout
Pump that leman 'till it pouts
Open your legs to the sensual sound
With the beauty of the beat on your pretty wet mound
I can tell you're like a horny bloodhound
Feel the bass, hug the ground
Just drop your knees and come unbound
And now you make your mouth to get on down
Our lust for notes will boil your blood
When they slither and slide on under your hood
Makin' me shoot my power packed pud
Like a wild lady loving a viable stud
Because of what is know as a juicy wet pud
Getting it getting it getting' it good
In my head, as a jellified hum
I take to rubbing her on the bum
Adjust the lips some on the tongue
With my thumb i strum her plum
Start to make her orgasm
Tastes a little bit like, ooh, how rum

[Outro]
Well i like to make her cum
To the rhythm of the drums
Make cum, make cum, cum



Thirty Dirty Birds - Freaky Styley - 1985

[Verse]
Thirty dirty birds
Sitting on a curb
Chirping and Burping
And eating
Dirty earthworms
Along comes Herbie
From thirty-third
And third
Saw the thirty
Dirty birds
Sitting on a curb
Chirping and Burping
And eating
Dirty earthworms
Boy he was
Disturbed



Yertle The Turtle - Freaky Styley - 1985

Look at that turtle go, bro

[Verse]
On a far away island
Of Salamasond
Yertle the turtle
Was king of the pond
A nice little pond
It was clean it was neat
The water was warm
There was plenty to eat
Until one day
The king of them all
Decided the kingdom
He ruled was too small
I'm a ruler of all that I see
But I don't see enough
And that's the trouble with me
With this stone for a throne
I am too low down
I cannot look down
Upon the places beyond
So Yertle the turtle king
Lifted his hand
And Yertle the turtle king
Gave a command
He ordered all the turtles
Onto one another's back
He piled them high
Into a ten turtle stack
I'm Yertle the turtle
The things I now rule
I'm king of a cow
I'm king of a mule
Then down from below
In the great turtle stack
Came a burp from a plain
Little turtle named Mack
Just part of the throne
This burping' little turtle
Looked up and said "I beg
Your pardon king Yertle"
I've pains in my back
My shoulders and my knees
How long must we stand
Here your majesty
"Silence !" the king of the
Turtles barked back
To the bad burping
Little turtle named Mack
I'm Yertle the turtle
Oh marvelous me for
I am ruler of all that I see

[Outro]
Yertle, Yertle the turtle[x2]



Bone - Freaky Styley - 1985

I said bone-crunching mayhem funk
Let me caroon you a tune, it's called the Brother's cup
'Cause we the Red Hot Chili Peppers
It'll rock your spine, and ruffle your feathers
So don't get me pissed, just spin my disk
Every night, every day, I want my radio played

Fight Like a Brave - The Uplift Mofo Party Plan - 1987

All you slingers and friends
Hide behind your rocks
Put down your guard
I'm not here to box
This is no showdown
So throw down your guns
You see it doesn't matter
Where you come from
You could be from Park Ave
Or from a park bench
You could be a politician
Or a bitchy princess
But if you're lookin' for a fist
And you're lookin' to unite
Put your knuckleheads together
Make a fist and fight
Not to your death
And not to your grave
I'm talkin' bout that freedom
Fight like a brave

[Chorus]
Fight like a brave - don't be a slave
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid

If you're sick-a-sick n tired
Of being sick and tired
If you're sick of all the bullshit
And you're sick of all the lies
It's better late than never
To set-a-set it straight
You know the lie is dead
So give yourself a break
Get it through your head
And get it off your chest
Get it out your arm
Because it's time to start fresh
You want to stop dying
The life you could be livin'
I'm here to tell a story
But I'm also here to listen
No I'm not your preacher
And I'm not your physician
I'm just trying to reach you
I'm a rebel with a mission

[Chorus x2]

(I am here today to pump up the Uplift Mofo Party Plan. A plan based on a band, a band based on a plan. There shall be no slaves in the land of lands, it's a Hollywood jam. )

You say you're running and you're running
And you're running afraid
You say you ran across the planet
But you couldn't get away
The fire in your brain
Was driving you insane
You were looking for a day
In a life that never came
So don't tell me that
I've got to take a number
Cause I've been to that doctor
And believe me that's a bummer
He's one of a kind
Convention of the mind
And don't forget to mention
That it doesn't cost a dime
Come as you like
And leave any time
And one more thing
You know it doesn't have to rhyme

[Chorus x4]

[Chorus 2]
Funky crime funky crime
Don't you know funk's colors blind
Well I've committed a funky crime
Against a state of mind

Hey you mister interview
I don't have to answer you
This is what I grew into
Don't judge me and my soul stew
Cause funk is my attitude
Funk is my attitude

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 2]
Barriers of race
In the media take place
Tellin'you there is no room
For what you do, don't budge
There's no groove to your gloom
Who made you the judge
Always room for funky tunes
And yes I funk it up

[Bridge]

Me and My Friends - The Uplift Mofo Party Plan - 1987

[Chorus]
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends[x4]

[Verse 1]
Like two sweet peas
In an even sweeter pod
That’s my friend
And my friend’s named Bob
Like the devil knows hell
I know Bobby well
Well enough to tell you
‘Bout his 67 smells
Well enough to tell you
He’s a hell-a-swell-a fellow
Well enough to tell you
That we know each other better
Than we know ourselves
Like freaks of a feather
We rock together
I know Bob well
But I think he knows me better

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
He’s as close to me
As a friend can be
I’ll be standin’ by my buddy
He’ll be standin’ by me
Just another half of
The two headed freak
Bit I need him like
My heart needs to beat
At this point
In this friendly verse
I’ve gotta sing a little something
That I haven’t rehearsed
It’s about my man
And his name is Hillel
For whom my love
Is soul-brother sacred
Take it Huckleberry
Slim Boy take it

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Jacky’s eyes are closed
But he’s right on course
Because he’s guided by
The invisible force
He drives a kooky green Chrysler
Bad as anybody’s Porsche
He’s a working class drummer
He’s as strong as a horse

[Chorus]



Backwoods - The Uplift Mofo Party Plan - 1987

[Verse 1]
Someone spilled blood many years ago
Someone spilled blood but do you know
That from the backwoods
Where the Chuck Berrys grow
Come your long tall
Daddies of rock and roll

[Chorus]
Take me to your backwoods now[x2]

[Verse 2]
Spinning down from the clouds
Like a tornado
Spinnin’ out of control
Like a psychedelic soul
With a rhythm hitting harder
Than Larry Holmes
Come your long tall
Daddies of rock and roll

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Mr. Uplift Mofo – my man Bo Diddley
Hit sipping a bottle of nickel ripple
Play the lickity split finger lickin’ licks
For all you wicked city slick chicks
And all you nitty gritty hicks
We’ll make your nipples ripple
Make you wanna dip your dipple
Make you wanna soak your hickory stick
That’s right
Because my man has a grip on it
And I do mean on it
Which brings to mind
A very sinister minister kind of guy
A man named Little Richard
Who was born to make them bitches stir
That’s right he’ll make the sweet substance drip
From the middle of your hillbilly lips
And like the farmer milks his cow
The Howling Wolf will howl
And since times does allow
You all can
Take me to your backwoods now

[Outro]
Take me to your backwoods now[x4]
Take me to your backwoods

He’s sitting at the bar – then he’s sitting at the booth
Across the dance floor he does scoot
He’s the skinny sweaty man in the green suit

[Chorus]
Skinny sweaty man in the green suit

The caboose that could he goes toot toot
Been known to gag and sometimes puke

But good buddy don’t be confused

Face to face with the man in the moon
His family doctor is Doctor Seuss
If you catch him in your soup please don't shoot
He's the skinny sweaty man in the green suit

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
He was new in town
A free wheelin’ clown
A very funny young duke
Hanging under the roof
Of a place in time
United sound

[Chorus]

[Verse 6]
He’ll play a little guitar sing a few blues
He’s the kind-a-guy that you can’t refuse
Despite the fact that he’s no brute
He’s the skinny sweaty man in the green suit

[Chorus]

[Verse 7]
Strike the magic groove make him jerk and move
Like an eight legged freak in snake skin boots
Coming soon to a theatre near you
He’s the skinny sweaty man in the green suit

Behind The Sun - The Uplift Mofo Party Plan - 1987

[Verse 1]
One day while bathing in the sea
My talking dolphin spoke to me
He spoke to me in symphony
From freedom's peace beneath the sea
He looked to me eyes full of love
Said yes we live behind the sun

[Chorus 1]
Behind the sun
Behind the sun
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Behind the sun

[Chorus 2]
The sun goes up
And the sun gets down
But like the heart of the sun
My heart continues to pound

Behind the sun

[Verse 2]
Now while I shower in the rain
I watch my dolphin swim away
The one who listens to the surf
Can feel the pulse beat of the earth
And like my dolphin swims so free
The sun does swim into the sea

[Chorus 1]
Behind the sun
Behind the sun
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Behind the sun
Behind the sun

[Verse 3]
An island flying through the sky
One day your son might ask you why
And if you son should be a girl
She too might ask you of this world
The sun shines sweet upon your beach
And yes my dolphin loves to teach

[Chorus 1]
Behind the sun
Behind the sun
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Behind the sun

[Chorus 2]
The sun goes up
And the sun gets down
But like the heart of the sun
My heart continues to pound

Behind the sun



Subterranean Homesick Blues - The Uplift Mofo Party Plan - 1987

[Verse 1]
Johnny's in the basement mixing up the medicine
I'm on the pavement thinking about the government
The man in the trench coat, badge out, laid off
Says he's got a bad cough: wants to get it paid off

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 2]
God knows when but you're doing' it again!
You better duck down the alleyway looking for a new friend
The man in the coonskin cap by the big pen
Wants eleven dollar bills: you only got ten

[Chorus 1]
Look out, kid
Look out, kid, it's something' that you did
Look out, kid, cause they keep all hid

[Verse 3]
Maggie comes fleet foot, face full of black soot
Talking at the heat put plants in the bed but
The phone's tapped anyway, Maggie says that many say
They must bust in early may
Orders from the D.A

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 4]
Walk on your tip toes, don't try "no doz"
Better stay away from those that carry around a fire hose
Keep a clean nose, watch the plain clothes
You don't need a weather man to know which way the wind blows

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 5]
Looks to me like you did
A little to much hitting' kid
You should've took it to the bridge
Before you started to skid

[Chorus 2]
Look out, kid
The good god willing, we'll bebop to Bob Dylan
Chilling em, thrilling em, and red hot killing em

Killing em

[Verse 6]
Get sick, get well, hand around a ink well
Ring bell, hard to tell if anything is going to sell
Try hard, get barred, get back, write braille
Get jailed, jump bail, join the army, if you fail

[Bridge]
But users, cheaters, six time losers
Hand around the theaters
Girl by the whirlpool looking for a new fool
Don't follow leaders, watch the parking meters

[Chorus 1]

Well, my young lady, she lives
Three houses away
She claims that she can hear moaning and screaming
To me fucking you every night

[Verse 1]
She's a witch
A bonafide bore
What's more - she snores
And that is a fact
Cow eyes lie

Get into this

Have kissed that bitch
So what if she's
Got big tits

She's the kinda girl
Who changes her mind really quick
She's the kinda girl who
Won't just let things sit

[Verse 2]
She came like a cat
Like a cat to cat nop
She came in my lap
With her womanly hips
When I first met her
I came unglued
I played the part of
A blue-blooded fool
I'm through with your sewage
I'm through with your trash
I always knew that I'd
Get the last laugh

[Chorus]
She's the kinda girl
Who changes her mind really quick
She's the kinda girl who
Won't just let things sit

Like two trains on one track
Bound for a crash
Two red white and blues we were
Destined to clash
I can't fix the future
I can't change the past
Like fly by night news
We were not meant to last
I'm through with your bluefish
I'm through with your gash
I'm through being screwed with by
You and your wack attack

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Jump back for chump love
You won't be back for cover
But no no no no
I'm no chump love sucker

I thought that your love
Was a matter of fact
But I lost my pride
When I realized that
The smack in my bag
And my baseball bat
Was all you were after
Boys "you dirty rat"
She's a bitch and a brat
And a living disaster
She thought she was fast
But I was faster

[Chorus]

But it can't be heaven
'cause the streets aren't gold
And everybody knows what bobby d was told
I'm walking on down the road

Grooving a tune straight out of the womb
Trust is a must to be a true blue dude
That's a matter of fact don't be confused

Everybody knows, everybody things, that I've done wrong
Everybody come in, everybody sing, sing my song

A dude he can't lose when he lives on love
Like the bark on a tree
Like the skin on my knees
I'm standing by my blood

[Chorus 1]

Millionaires Against Hunger  - The Uplift Mofo Party Plan - 1987

[Chorus 1]
We're millionaires
Against hunger

[Chorus 2]
I'm a millionaire
And I got something to say
I got a million more that'll take me away
All the other ones' bills starting to percolate
As far as I'm concerned, why that's okay

[Verse 1]
Well I'm a millionaire too, but not like you
As far as I'm concerned, I got a job to do
I've got to pave the way, I've got to save the day
I've got to make it better, I've got to say
You and I, we're millionaires, but we're a million miles away from the saint who stares
Upon the millions who die, every day of the week
Just because they can't get enough to eat
While we the rich dine on all these feasts, and everything's fine, yeah peaches and creme
But it just isn't something you've got to realize, there's something wrong, we've got to open our eyes
When the world cries, we just can't hide, we've got a job to do, we've got to save some lives

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 3]
Hey hey Mr. Millionaire
Twice as nice when you share
Hey hey Mr. Millionaire
A spiritual price do you care
Hey hey Mr. Millionaire
Dice the mice when you share
Hey hey Mr. Millionaire
Pave the way, take the dare

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 2]
Well I'm a millionaire too
All I know that is true is that I've got more cash than I can use
I want anything that I can have, but I don't need nothin' and I never have
Each damn day my heart's set far, but I'll be okay, cuz I don't starve
Kids from the street the losing their emotion so damn snobby so out of touch
With two hungry people who die as they stare at the city at night, you know it gives to share
So listen up, you millionaires, every woman, every man, help all you can
All races unite, and I will now concern to the type of problem that helps us learn

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 3]



Good Time Boys  - Mothers Milk - 1989

[Verse 1]
Indeed, it may seem that we have strange ways
But we do it with compassion and don't believe in age
Travel round the world, getting naked on the stage
Busting people out of their everyday cage
We like to think we make a sad man happy
And we like to make proud our mami and our papi
Funky young kings, we sing of truth and soul
We're the modern day braves with one strong hold
Through the world of song our boldness is exposed
I'm talking about my buddies, funk it up Fishboneeeee!

[Chorus]
Good, good time boys, make me feel good
Give me good times, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Our devotion to emotion is more than evident
To the minds that are open it's you we represent
We hope you have enjoyed the time that you have spent
One day, the good time boys that might jest be president
Like a pack of mad hatters who come from outer space
Our swinging's going to shatter every stone cold face
Now you may not know the exact reason why
A band commands attention from the mountains and the sky
Making more that money, more than money can buy
I stop! And take a listen to the monsters try

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
If you don't believe me you can ask John Doe
Because his heart is made of glory and his voice is made of gold
He'll tell you in a minute about the men he knows
He'll tell you about the band called fire hose
To those of you who doubt the nature of our spirit
We play it out loud for everyone to hear it
Building up our brains with the supernatural powers
We take it from the trees and the mighty watts towers
Aim the flame of freedom at the lames and sours
We're the best of the west and the west is ours

[Chorus]



Higher Ground  - Mothers Milk - 1989

Soldiers

Going to keep on trying until I reach the highest ground

[Outro]
And Stevie knows that, uh, nobody's going to bring me down
Until I reach the highest ground
Because me and Stevie, see, we're going to be sailing on the funky sound
Until I reach the highest ground
Busting out, and I'll break you out, because I'm sailing on
Until I reach the highest ground
Just, uh, sailing on, sailing on the higher ground
Until I reach the highest ground



Subway To Venus  - Mothers Milk - 1989

[Verse 1]
Step right up and listen please
You're going to get it with the greatest of ease
Everybody gather round, all aboard the underground
You've got to get in before you get out
And getting out is what it's going to be about
If you find that you are blind
Open your bashful mind
Let my band step inside
And take you on a cosmic ride
With honest sounds I'll paint your brain
For in this song, I do proclaim
That once aboard this moving train
I'll do my best to ease your pain
Slinky as my speech may be
On this trip you'll ride for free
This axis bold as love you see comes and goes so easily

[Chorus]
Space is king or so I sing, subway to Venus

[Verse 2]
Once aboard and feeling smooth
Like a liquid you will ooze
Into a state of mind that soothes
Aw, be my quest inside my grove
Because what I've got to give to you
Is going to make you wiggle like a wiggley worm
Because you deserve to wiggle and squirm
Life's too short to be in a hole
So bust into your funkiest stroll

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Take your body, shake it around
Do the dog on the ground
And if I can't make you dance
I guess I'll just have to make you piss your pants

[Chorus]



Magic Johnson  - Mothers Milk - 1989

[Chorus]
L.A. Lakers, fast break makers
Kings of the court, shake and bake all takers
Back to back is a bad-ass fact, a claim that remains in tact

[Verse 1]
M-A-G-I-C see you on the court
Buck has come to play his way and his way is to thwart
M-A-G-I-C magic of the buck
Other teams pray for dreams
But he doesn't give a [fuck]
Penetrating the lane like a bullet train
Comes the magic blood a telepathic brain
Knucklehead suckers better duck
When the buck comes through like a truck
Scott stops, pops and drops it in
On his way back, gets a little skin
From the hand of a man named A.C. Green
Slam so hard, break your TV screen
Worthy's hot with his tomahawk
Take it to the hole, make your mama talk

[Pre-Chorus]
I hate to burst your bubble, but triple double trouble
Is coming to your town and he's going to make rubble

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Lakers are the team that I watch on the telly
Because they've got more moves
Than a bowl full of jelly
The buck stops here, pops, then cheers
A roar through the Forum
That deafens my ears
The one and only know of his kind
Sits in a throne
Not for the records that he holds
But for being bald and bold
Kareem Abdul Jabbar
All-time great super, super star

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]



Nobody Weird Like Me - Mothers Milk - 1989

[Pre-Chorus]
The freakiest show I know
Is the show of my own
Living my life in and out
Of the twilight zone

[Chorus]
Bust my britches
Bless my soul
I'm a freak of nature
Walking totem pole
Look and see, I think you'll agree
Nobody weird like me

[Verse 1]
Intercourse with a porpoise
Is a dream for me
Hell-bent on inventing
A new species

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Riding down the path
On the back of a giraffe
Me and the giraffe laughed
Because I passed some gas

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Enchanted as a rabbit
That my life is a dream
Well, everything is never
Just as it seems

[Pre-Chorus]



Knock Me Down - Mothers Milk - 1989

[Verse 1]
Never too soon to be through
Being cool too much, too soon
Too much for me, too much for you
You're gonna lose in time
Don't be afraid to show your friends
That you hurt inside, inside
Pain's part of life
Don't hide behind your false pride
It's a lie, your lie

[Chorus]
If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life
If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life

[Verse 2]
I'm tired of being untouchable
I'm not above the love
I'm part of you and you're part of me
Why did you go away
Finding what you're looking for
Can end up being being such a bore
I pray for you most every day
My love's with you now fly away

[Chorus]
If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life
If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life
If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life
If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life
If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life
If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life
If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life
If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life

[Outro]
It's so lonely when you don't even know yourself
It's so lonely
It's so lonely when you don't even know yourself
It's so lonely
It's so lonely when you don't even know yourself
It's so lonely
It's so lonely when you don't even know yourself



Taste The Pain - Mothers Milk - 1989

[Verse 1]
Flat on my back
In a lonely sprawl
I stare at the ceiling
Because I cannot fall
Asleep tonight
No, not at all
Head lights flash
Across my bedroom wall
Crying eyes open
Because I cannot fall
In love with you
No, not at all

[Chorus]
Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid
Funny how the price gets paid
Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid
Funny how the price gets paid

[Verse 2]
Busted in two
Like a brittle stick
I cannot drink
Because my throat constricts
Love-sick from you
That will never do
Open my mouth
I couldn't make a sound
I could not scream
You know I could not shout
It out to you
Nothing to do

[Chorus]
Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid
Funny how the price gets paid
Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid
Funny how the price gets paid

[Bridge]
This may come as a shocking surprise
I have to take a walk
I have to kiss it goodbye
Goodbye, my love
Goodbye, my love
I am not alive

[Chorus]
Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid
Funny how the price gets paid
Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid
Funny how the price gets paid

[Outro]
Oh oh how the price gets paid
Well I got to pay, I got to pay the price
I think I'll walk away
'Cause I couldn't survey, I couldn't pay
I couldn't price

Except the skirt on your ass
When you're living on the streets
You've got to let it roll

You've got no secrets to tell
But when you smoke that rock and suck that cock
You do it oh so well

Echo sounds of soul
Time after time

She's stone cold bush
She's stone cold bush

Oh, can I make love with your fire?

Let me stand next to your fire
Funky, funky fire

Now listen to this baby
And stop acting so crazy

Oh, I'm going to do it in your fire

You know he's bad, you know he drowns, you know who he gives it to, yeah

You better save it, babe
Save it for your rainy day

Oh, can I make love over your fire?

[Chorus][x4]

[Outro]
You better slide you ass over, girl
Because I'm coming through once and I'm coming the way you must be

Sexy Mexican Maid - Mothers Milk - 1989

[Verse 1]
Hair so smooth, black as coal
Oh baby, the way you sway
You wear the dress so very blue
That you take my blues away
She comes and goes, that I know
She cums at least once a day
I can't resist, I kiss your lips [sic]
You're my sexy Mexican maid

Let me please get on my knees, I come alone

[Verse 2]
When I wake up in the morning
She greets me where I lay
I look outside to find that it's a bright and sunny day
So serene, she gives to me my toast and marmalade
What more can I say?
She's my sexy Mexican maid

[Chorus]
My angel girl she sings to me
Baby, tell me this is not a dream

Then we make it very fast

My angel girl she sings to me
Baby, tell me this is not a dream
She's pushing me onto my knees
I'm praying to my baby, she screams
Squeezing me so tight, I cry

Let me please get on my knees, I come alone



Johnny Kick A Hole In The Sky - Mothers Milk - 1989

[Verse]
I cry, I cry
I was born in a land, I don't think you understand
God, damn what I am
I'm a native of this place, please don't kick me in my face
My race has been disgraced
Won't somebody testify, kick a hole right in the sky
Testify, testify, kick a hole right in the sky
Slap a liar in his eye, kick a hole right in the sky
Testify, testify kick a hole right in the sky
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny
Puts us in a pumpkin shell, where you keep us very well
It's hell, where I dwell
When history books are full of shit, I become the anarchist
I'm pissed at this
What this country claims to be
It's a lie
No place for me
I bleed
Kill my trust if you must
But in my blood there is lust for life
That's right
Apache blood is in my heart, thrashing though me like a shark
Crashing though the dark
What am I supposed to do?
I feel like I'm cut in two
Confused by rules
Do these cultures clash or am I living in the past?
I ask please tell me fast
To what do I belong and if I change will I be wrong
I took my foot, kicked a hole in the sky
I proceeded to plead, father help me decide
A jagged flash of light struck me in the eye
I turned around and found that I was still alive
Snakes rise high from the purple black sky
The red cloud rains and the black horse rides
Then it dawned on my like the morning sun
I'm a part of two worlds and the morning comes
Glowing embers tend to remember when
The power that is peace was treated as a friend
I am a master of and I've got to take action
I'm a man, the animal man

Crosstown Traffic - Mothers Milk - 1989

[Verse 1]
You jump in front of my car when
You know all the time that
Ninety miles an hour, girl, is the speed I drive
You tell me it's alright, you don't mind a little pain
You say you just want me to take you for a ride

[Chorus]
You're just like crosstown traffic
So hard to get through to you
Crosstown traffic
I don't need to run over you
Crosstown traffic
All you do is slow me down
And I'm trying to get on the other side of town

[Verse 2]
I'm not the only soul who's accused of hit and run
Tire tracks all across your back
I can see you had your fun
But darling, can't you see my signals turn from green to red
And with you I can see a traffic jam straight up ahead

[Chorus]

Knock Me Down - Mothers Milk - 1989

Never too soon to be through
Being cool too much too soon
Too much for me and too much for you
You're gonna loose in time

Every turn looking to burn
Some never learn live and learn
Stop searching for a curse
Before you end up in a hearse

Don't be afraid to show your friends
That you hurt inside inside
Pain's part of life don't hide behind your false pride
It's a lie, your lie

Don't slip away and don't forget
I'll give you more than you can get
It's so lonely when you don't even know yourself
Come to me

If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life

I'm tired of being untouchable
I'm not above the love
I'm part of you and you're part of me
Why did you go away

Too late to tell you how I feel
I want you back but I get real
Can you hear my falling tears
Making rain where you lay

Finding what you're looking for
Can end up being such a bore
I pray for you most every day
My love's with you now fly away

If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life

If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life

It's so lonely when you don't even know yourself.....



The Power of Equality - Blood Sugar Sex Magik - 1991

[Verse 1]
I've got a soul that can not sleep
At night when something just ain't right
Blood red, but without sight
Exploding egos in the night
Mix like sticks of dynamite
Red, black, or white, this is my fight
Come on courage, let's be heard
Turn feelings into words
American equality has always been sour
An attitude I would like to devour
My name is peace, this is my hour
Can I get just a little bit of power

[Hook]
The power of equality
Is not yet what it ought to be
It fills me up like a hollow tree
The power of equality

[Verse 2]
Right or wrong, my song is strong
You don't like it, get along
Say what I want, do what I can
Death to the message of the Ku Klux Klan
I don't buy supremacy
Media chief, you menance me
The people you say cause all the crime
Wake up motherfucker and smell the slime
Blackest anger, whitest fear
Can you hear me, am I clear
My name is peace, this is my hour
Can I get just a little bit of power

[Hook]
The power of equality
Is not yet what it ought to be
It fills me up like a hollow tree
The power of equality

[Verse 3]
I've got tapes
I've got c.d.'s
I've got my Public Enemy
My lilly white ass is tickled pink
When I listen to the music that makes me think
Not another motherfuckin' politician
Doin' nothin' but something for his own ambition
Never touch the sound we make
Soul sacred love, vows that we take
To create straight what is true
Yo he's with me and what I do
My name is peace, this my hour
Can I get just a little bit of power

[Hook]
The power of equality
Is not yet what it ought to be
It fills me up like a hollow tree
The power of equality

[Verse 4]
Madder than a motherfucker, lick my finger
Can't forget, cause the memory lingers
Count 'em off quick, little piccadilly sickness
Take me to the hick, eat my thickness
I've got a welt from the Bible belt
Dealing with the hand that I've been dealt
Sitting in the grip of a killing fist
Giving up blood just to exist
Rub me wrong and I get pissed
No I can not get to this
People in pain, I do not dig it
Change of brain for Mr. Bigot
Little brother do you hear me
Have a heart oh come get near me
Misery is not my friend
But I'll break before I bend
What I see is insanity
Whatever happened to humanity
Whatever happened to humanity
Whatever happened to humanity



If You Have To Ask - Blood Sugar Sex Magik - 1991

[Verse 1]
A wanna be gangster thinkin' he's a wise guy
Rob another bank, he's a sock 'em in the eye guy
Tank head, Mr. Bonnie and Clyde guy
Look him the eye, he's not my kinda guy
Never wanna be confusion proof
Pudding's sweet but too aloof
Orange eye girl with a backslide dew said
Yo homie who you talkin' to
A backed up paddywagon mackin' on a cat's ass
One uppercut to the cold upper middle class
Born to storm on boredom's face
And a little lust to the funky ass Flea bass
Most in the race just lose their grace
The blackest hole in all of space
Crooked as a hooker, now suck my thumb
Anybody wanna come get some

[Hook]
If you have to ask
You'll never know
Funky motherfuckers
Will not be told to go

[Verse 2]
Don't ask me why I'm flyin' so high
Mr. Bubble meets superfly in my third eye
Searchin' for a soul bride, she's my freakette
Soak it up inside, deeper than a secret
Much more than meets the eye
To the funk I fall into my new ride
My hand my hand, magic on the one is a medicine man
Thinkin' of a few taboos that I ought to kill
Dancin' on their face like a stage on Vaudeville

I feel so good can't be understood
Booty of a hoodlum rockin' my red hood

[Hook]



Breaking the Girl - Blood Sugar Sex Magik - 1991

[Verse 1]
I am a man
Cut from the know
Rarely do friends
Come and then go
She was a girl
Soft but estranged
We were the two
Our lives rearranged
Feeling so good that day
A feeling of love that day

[Chorus]
Twisting and turning
Your feelings are burning
You're breaking the girl
(She meant you no harm)
Think you're so clever
But now you must sever
You're breaking the girl
(He loves no one else)

[Verse 2]
Raised by my dad
Girl of the day
He was my man
That was the way
She was the girl
Left alone
Feeling the need
To make me her home
I don't know what, when or why
The twilight of love had arrived

[Chorus]
Twisting and turning
Your feelings are burning
You're breaking the girl
(She meant you no harm)
Think you're so clever
But now you must sever
You're breaking the girl
(He loves no one else)

[Chorus]
Twisting and turning
Your feelings are burning
You're breaking the girl
(She meant you no harm)
Think you're so clever
But now you must sever
You're breaking the girl
(He loves no one else)



Funky Monks - Blood Sugar Sex Magik - 1991

[Verse 1]
There are no monks in my band
There are no saints in this land
I'll be doin' all I can
I live, I die an honest man
Confusion is my middle name
Ask me again I'll tell you the same
Persuaded by one sexy dame
No I do not feel no shame

[Hook]
You are all alone
Can I get a little lovin' from you?
Can I get a little bit of that done did do?
You are on the road
Tell me now girl that you need me too
Tell me now girl cause I've got a feeling for you

[Verse 2]
Every man has certain needs
Talkin' 'bout them dirty deeds
To these needs I must concede
Livin' by my lowly creed
Woman please know that I'm good
Know that I did all I could
But yes it's true that likelihood
Of being great is not so good

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
There are no monks in my band
There are no saints in this land
I'll be doin' all I can
I live, I die an honest man
Virtue slipped into my shoe
No I will not misconstrue
More rockin' more rockin' now doobley do
Dancin' down your avenue

I Could Have Lied - Blood Sugar Sex Magik - 1991

[Verse 1]
There must be something in the way I feel
That she don't want me to feel
The stare she bares cut me, I don't care
You see so what if I bleed
I could never change just what I feel
My face will never show what is not real

[Verse 2]
A mountain never seemed to have the need to speak
A look that shares so many seek
The sweetest feeling I got from you
The things I said to you were true
I could never change just what I feel
My face will never show what is not real

[Hook]
I could have lied I'm such a fool
My eyes could never never never keep their cool
Showed her and I told her how
She struck me but I'm fucked up now

[Guitar Solo]

But now she's gone yes she's gone away
A soulful song that would not stay
You see she hides cause she is scared
But I don't care, I won't be spared

Mellowship Slinky In B Major - Blood Sugar Sex Magik - 1991

[Verse 1]
I've got a mellowship, I've got a fellowship
I've got a nonstop "yo swan" hello chip
Born to adore the big bad bison
Thunderstorm and a man like Tyson
Popcorn peanuts lookin' at big butts
No I can not keep my mouth shut
Rockin' to the beat of the fabulous Forum
My Lakers I adore 'em
Blush my lady when I tell her
That I do indeed love to smell her
Sopping wet your pink umbrella
Do the dog with Isabella
I'm so in love yes with an artist
Imagination, he's the smartest
Robert Williams, stroke and splatter
I attest to your gray matter
Living kings how true it rings
These are just a few of my favorite things

[Hook 1]
Good God where's my sleigh now
Good God playing for days now
Good God any day now
Good God take me away now
Good God purple haze now
Good God the baddest of brains now
Good God anyday now
Good God ridin' my sleigh now

[Verse 2]
Being that I'm the duke of my domain
My hat goes off to Mark Twain
Singing a song about what true men don't do
Killing another creature that's kind of blue
Writing about the world of the wild coyote
Good man Truman Copote
Talking about my throughts cause they must grow
Cock my brain to shoot my load
I'm on the porch cause I lost my housekey
Pick up my book I read Bukowski
Can I get another kiss from you
Kiss me right here on my tattoo

[Hook 2]
Good God where's my sleigh now
Good God playing for days now
Good God any day now
Good God take me away
Good God DeNiro's insane now
Good God rackin' my brain now
Good God anyday now
Good God take me away now take me away

[Verse 3]
Me my friends and the sex machine
Do unto others like my brother Bean
I know you've got a mother
So give her a hug
I know you've got a mother
With a whole lot of love
Billy sings and Basie swings
These are just a few of my favorite things

I can't rest in war

Give It Away - Blood Sugar Sex Magik - 1991

[Verse 1]
What I've got you've got to give it to your mamma
What I've got you've got to give it to your pappa
What I've got you've got to give it to your daughter
You do a little dance and then you drink a little water
What I've got you've got to get it put it in you
What I've got you've got to get it put it in you
What I've got you've got to get it put it in you

How come everybody wanna keep it like the kaiser

Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now

Greedy little people in a sea of distress
Keep your more to receive your less
Unimpressed by material excess
Love is free, love me, say, "Hell yes"
I'm a low brow but I rock a little know how
No time for the piggies or the hoosegow
Get smart get down with the pow wow
Never been a better time than right now

Bob Marley taught me how to off it
Bob Marley walking like he talk it
Goodness me can't you see I'm gonna cough it

Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now

[Backwards Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Lucky me swimming in my ability
Dancing down on life with agility
Come and drink it up from my fertility
Blessed with a bucket of lucky mobility
My mom I love her cause she love me
Long gone are the times when she scrub me
Feeling good my brother gonna hug me
Drink my juice young love chug-a-lug me
There's a river born to be a giver
Keep you warm won't let you shiver
His heart is never gonna wither
Come on everybody time to deliver

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Blood sugar sucker fish in my dish
How many pieces do you wish
Step into a heaven where I keep it on the soul side
Girl please me, be my soul bride
Every woman has a piece of aphrodite
Copulate to create a state of sexual light
Kissing her virginity
My affinity
I mingle with the gods
I mingle with divinity

[Verse 2]
Glorious euphoria is my must
Erotic shock is a function of lust
Temporarily blind, dimension to discover
In time, each into the other
Uncontrollable notes from her snow white throat
Fill a space in which two bodies float
Operatic by voice
A fanatic by choice
Aromatic is the flower
She must be moist

Under the Bridge - Blood Sugar Sex Magik - 1991

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel like my only friend
Is the city I live in, the city of angels
Lonely as I am, together we cry
I drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills 'cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
Well, I never worry, now that is a lie

[Chorus]
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love, take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love, take me all the way

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there
It's hard to believe that I'm all alone
At least I have her love, the city, she loves me
Lonely as I am, together we cry

[Chorus]
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love, take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love, take me all the way

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah yeah
Oh, no, no, no, yeah yeah
Love me, I say, yeah yeah
One time

[Outro]
(Under the bridge downtown) Is where I drew some blood
(Under the bridge downtown) I could not get enough
(Under the bridge downtown) Forgot about my love
(Under the bridge downtown) I gave my life away
Yeah, yeah yeah
Oh, no, no, no, yeah yeah
Here I stay, yeah yeah
Here I stay



Naked in the Rain - Blood Sugar Sex Magik - 1991

[Verse 1]
Standing on the corner of civilization
There's a time there's a place for me
In a world where I can't be found
Cold and mean people give me the creeps
Going to the jungle where the elephant roams
Got to get away, going to make it my home

Losing my taste for the human race
Social grace is a waste of time
It's absurd when I look around
So sublime that we blow my mind
Naked in the rain with a killer whale
I can taste the salt when I lick his tail

[Chorus]
Naked in the rain
Doctor Doolittle, what's your secret?
Give it to me doctor
Don't keep it

[Verse 2]
I never met an animal that I didn't like
You can come to me, I won't bite
Don't you know dog is man's best friend
There is some love that you can't fight
Naked in the rain with black tattoos
Running through the woods laughing at the blues

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Listen to the talking heart in my chest
With this gift, good Lord, I am blessed
There's a lump and it's in my throat
I'm in love with the wilderness
Naked in the river skinny-dipping my way
In the waterfall, I just want to play

[Chorus]



Apache Rose Peacock - Blood Sugar Sex Magik - 1991

[Verse 1]
Sittin' on a sack of beans
Sittin' down in New Orleans
You wouldn't believe what I've seen
Sitting on that sack of beans
Lunatics on pogo sticks
Another southern fried freak on a crucifix
Hicks don't mix with politics
People on the street just kickin' to the licks

[Hook]
Yes my favorite place to be
Is not a land called Honah Lee
Mentally or physically
I wanna be in New Orleans

[Verse 2]
Oh good brother just when I thought
That I had seen it all
My eyes popped out, my dick got hard
And I dropped my jaw
I saw a bird walkin down the block
Name Apache Rose Peacock
I could not speak I was in shock
I told my knees to please not knock

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
A little boy came along
Name of Louis Armstrong
Said that girl who left me silly
She liked the looks of me and my willy
So I found her in the quarter
Good God how I adored her
Oh she made me feel so cozy
When she told me I could call her Rosey

[Bridge]
I kiss your hair your skin so bare
I'll take you with me girl anywhere
You fare well in stormy weather
I never met a girl that I liked better

[Verse 4]
Twinkle twinkle little star
Shining down on my blue car
Drivin' down the boulevard
She was soft and I was hard
Apache Rose gotta rockin' peacock
Hottest ass on the goddamn block
Rockin' to the beat of the funky ass Meters
She has one of those built in heaters

[Bridge]
I kiss your hair your skin so bare
I'll take you with me girl anywhere
You fare well in stormy weather
I never met a girl that I liked better

[Verse 5]
Voodoo gurus casting their spells
Cockatoo drag queens shakin' their bells
Silver sound escapes the trumpet
Watch your leg someone might hump it
Chicken strut your butt let's rock
Gettin' it on under your frock
Flowing like a flame all through the night
My girl's insane but it's all right

[Hook]



The Greeting Song - Blood Sugar Sex Magik - 1991

[Verse 1]
Drivin' around, I've got my baby and my top down
Mary-go-round I ride you for my love
Throwin' me down in the backseat underground
I'm on the mound I make it for my love

[Verse 2]
Makin' my way, I break another L.A. day
Time in the town I need it for my love
My Chevrolet rollin' to another play day
This is the sound I listen for my love

[Chorus]
Who you talking to? Talk to me, you
Sound of music
Who you talking to? Talk to me, you
Sound of music
I love you, swim through me
Good feelings, come to me

[Verse 3]
Sought and I found a life of making my blood-sound
Do anything for the one I love
Something profound, the face of God is in Sensurround
I'm on the mound I make it for my love

[Chorus]
Who you talking to? Talk to me, you
Sound of music
Who you talking to? Talk to me, you
Sound of music
I love you, swim through me
Good feelings, come to me



My Lovely Man - Blood Sugar Sex Magik - 1991

[Verse 1]
I used to shout across the room to you
And you'd come dancin' like a fool
Shuffle step, you funky mother
Come to me, all warm as covers
Rest with me, my lovely brother
For you see, there is no other
Memory so sad and sweet
I'll see you soon, save me a seat

[Hook]
Well I'm cryin'
Now my lovely man
Yes I'm cryin'
Now and no one can
Ever fill the
The hole you left my man
I'll see you later
My lovely man if I can

[Verse 2]
In my room, I'm all alone
Waiting for you to get home
Listen to Roberta Flack
But I know you won't come back

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Just in case you never knew
I miss you Slim
I love you too
See my heart
It's black and blue
When I die
I will find you

Sir Psycho Sexy - Blood Sugar Sex Magik - 1991

[Verse 1]
A long, long, long, long time ago
Before the wind, before the snow
Lived a man, lived a man I know
Lived a freak of nature named Sir Psycho
Sir Psycho Sexy that is me
Sometimes I find I need to scream

[Bridge]
He's a freak of nature
But we love him so
He's a freak of nature
But we let him go

[Verse 2]
Deep inside the garden of Eden
Standing there with my hard on bleedin'
Theres a devil in my dick and some demons in my semen
Good God no that would be treason
Believe me Eve she gave good reason
Booty looking too good not to be squeezin'
Creamy beaver hotter than a fever
I'm a givin' cause she's the reciever
I won't and I don't hang up until I please her
Makin' her feel like an over achiever
I take it away for a minute just to tease her
Then I give it back a little bit deeper

[Hook]
Sir Psycho, Sir Psycho, yeah (he's the man that I met one time)
Sir Psycho, Sir Psycho, yeah (he's the man that left me blind)
Sir Psycho, Sir Psycho, yeah (he's the man he's the man he's the man)
Sir Psycho, Sir Psycho, yeah

[Bridge]
He's a freak of nature
But we love him so
He's a freak of nature
But we let him go

[Verse 3]
I got stopped by a lady cop
In my automobile
She said get out and spead your legs
And then she tried to cop a feel
That cop she was all dressed in blue
Was she pretty? Boy I'm tellin' you
She stuck my butt with her big black stick
I said "what's up?" now suck my dick
Like a ram getting ready to jam the lamb
She whimpered just a little when she felt my hand
On her crotch so very warm
I could feel her getting wet through her uniform
Proppin' her up on the black and white
Unzipped and slipped "ooo that's tight"
I swatted her like no swat team can
Turned a cherry pie right into jam

[Hook]
Sir Psycho, Sir Psycho, yeah (I'm the man that you met one time)
Sir Psycho, Sir Psycho, yeah (I'm the man that'll leave you blind)
Sir Psycho, Sir Psycho, yeah (I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man)
Sir Psycho, Sir Psycho, yeah

[Verse 4]
Hello young woman that I love
Pretty punk rock mamma that I'm thinking of
Hold me naked if you will
In your arms in your legs in your pussy I'd kill
To be with you, to kiss with you, I do miss you
I love you

[Bridge]
Lay me down, lay me down, lay me down
Descending waves of graceful pleasure
For your love there is no measure
Her curves they bend with subtle splendor

[Verse 5]
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the funk will make me freak
If I should die before I waked
Allow me Lord to rock out naked
Bored by the ordinary time to take a trip
Calling up a little girl with a bull whip
Lickety split go snap "snap"
Girl gettin' off all in my lap
The tallest tree the sweetest sap
Blowin' my ass right off the map
Ooh and it's nice out here
I think I'll stay for a while

Little miss lover
Where have you been in this world for so long
Well, I love a lover that feels like you
Would you like to tag along?

Castles Made Of Sand - Blood Sugar Sex Magik - 1991

[Verse 1]
Down the street you can hear her scream
"You're a disgrace"
As she slams the door in his drunken face
And now he stands outside
And all the neighbors start to gossip and drool
He cries "Oh girl, you must be mad
What happened to the sweet love you and me had?"
Against the door he leans and starts a scene
And his tears fall and burn the garden green

[Chorus]
And so castles made of sand
Fall in the sea eventually

[Verse 2]
A little Indian, brave before he was ten
Played war games in the woods with his Indian friends
And he built a dream that when he grew up
He would be a fearless warrior Indian chief
Many moons passed and the dream grew strong until tomorrow
He would sing his first war song
And fight his first battle but something went wrong
Surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night

[Chorus]

"Take it, Johnny"

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
There was a young girl whose heart was a frown
Because she was crippled for life and couldn't speak a sound
And she wished and prayed she could stop living
So she decided to die
She drew her wheel chair to the edge of the shore
And to her legs she smiled
"You won't hurt me no more"
But then a sight she'd never seen made her jump and say
"Look a golden winged ship is passing my way"
But it really didn't have to stop
It just kept on going

[Chorus]
And so castles made of sand
Slip in the sea eventually



Warped - One Hot Minute - 1995

[Verse 1]
My tendency
For dependency
Is offending me
It's upending me
I'm pretending see
To be strong and free
From my dependency
It's warping me

So much love
So rare to dare
Afraid of
Ever being there
Take me home
I need repair
Take me please
To anywhere

[Chorus]
Descend
All the way
All the way
Everyday
Warped
And scared
Of
Being
There

[Verse 2]
Descended from
Demented men
Struggle with
The art of Zen
Please don't look
Too close at me
You might not like
What you see

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Night craving
Sends me crawling oh
Beg for mercy
Does it show
A vacancy
That's full of holes
Hold me please
I'm feeling cold

[Chorus]



Aeroplane - One Hot Minute - 1995

[Hook]
I like pleasure spiked with pain
And music is my Aeroplane
It's my Aeroplane
Songbird sweet and sour Jane
And music is my Aeroplane
It's my Aeroplane
Pleasure spiked with pain
That motherfucker's always spiked with pain

[Verse 1]
Looking in my own eyes, hey Lord
I can find the love I want
Someone better slap me
Before I start to rust
Before I start to decompose
Looking in my rearview mirror
Looking in my rearview mirror
I can make it disappear
I can make it disappear, have no fear

[Hook]
I like pleasure spiked with pain
And music is my Aeroplane
It's my Aeroplane
Songbird sweet and sour Jane
And music is my Aeroplane

Pleasure spiked with pain
That motherfucker's always spiked with pain

[Verse 2]
Sitting in my kitchen, hey girl
I'm turning into dust again
My melancholy baby
The star of Mazzy must
Push her voice inside of me
I'm overcoming gravity
I'm overcoming gravity
It's easy when you're sad to be
It's easy when you're sad, sad like me

[Hook]
I like pleasure spiked with pain
And music is my Aeroplane
It's my Aeroplane
Songbird sweet and sour Jane
And music is my Aeroplane
It's my Aeroplane
Pleasure spiked with pain
That motherfucker's always spiked with pain

[Verse 3]
Just one note could make me float
Could make me float away
One note from the song she wrote
Could fuck me where I lay
Just one note could make me choke
One note, that's not a lie
Just one note could cut my throat
One note could make me die

[Hook]
I like pleasure spiked with pain
And music is my Aeroplane
It's my Aeroplane
Songbird sweet and sour Jane
And music is my Aeroplane
It's my Aeroplane
Pleasure spiked with pain
That motherfucker's always spiked with pain

It's my Aeroplane...



Deep Kick - One Hot Minute - 1995

[Verse 1]
It started when we were little kids
Free spirits, but already tormented by our own hands
Given to us by our parents
We got together and wrote on desks
And slept in laundry rooms near snowy mountains
And slipped through whatever cracks we could find
Minds altered, we didn't falter
In portraying hysterical and tragic characters in a smog filled universe
We loved the dirty city
And the journeys away from it
We had not yet been or seen our friends, selves
Chase tails round and round in downward spirals
Leaving trail of irretrievable, vital life juice behind
Still, the brothers, blood comrades, partner, family, cousin was impenetrable
And we lived inside it
Laughing with no clothes, and everything experimental until death was upon us
In our face, mortality
And lots of things seemed futile then, but love and music can save us
And did, while the giant grey monster grew
More poisoned and volatile around us
Jaws clamping down and spewing ugly shit around
Nothing is the same
So we keep moving
We keep moving

[Chorus 1]
(Ooh Shit! Ooh Shit!)

[Verse 2]
Went off and got some hair cuts
Looking wild and got all drugged up
Hopped a train into the night
Got a ride with a transvestite
Two boys in San Francisco
Two boys in San Francisco
Blasted off in a BART bathroom
Those coppers woke us up
The motherfuckers woke us up

[Chorus 2]
Two young brothers on a hovercraft
Telepathic love and belly laughs

[Verse 3]
Storm the stage of Universal
Slim shine talk boy go subversal
Papa's proud and so he sent us
Pounding hearts full and relentless
Two boys in London, England
Two boys in London, England
Climbing out of hostel windows
Wearing gear so out but in though
Come on kid and do the no, no

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 4]
We went to Fairfax High School
Jumped off buildings into their pools
We'd sit down and grease at Canters
Run like hell they can't catch us
Two boys in L.A. proper
Two boys in L.A. proper
Stealing anything that we could
Got to sneak into the Starwood
Got to peak into the deep good

I remember
10 years ago in Hollywood
We did some good
And we did some real bad stuff
But the Butt-hole Surfers said
It's better to regret something you did
Than something you didn't do
Yea, we were young
And we were looking
Looking
Looking for that deep kick
Yea, een them come, seen them go



My Friends - One Hot Minute - 1995

[Verse 1]
My friends are so depressed
I feel the question
Of your loneliness
Confide, cause I'll be on your side
You know I will, you know I will

[Verse 2]
Ex-girlfriend called me up
Alone and desperate
On the prison phone
They want to give her 7 years
For being sad

[Chorus]
I love all of you
Hurt by the cold
So hard and lonely too
When you don't know yourself

[Verse 3]
My friends are so distressed
And standing on
The brink of emptiness
No words I know of to express
This emptiness

[Chorus]
I love all of you
Hurt by the cold
So hard and lonely too
When you don't know yourself

[Bridge]
Imagine me, taught by tragedy
Release is peace

[Verse 4]
I heard a little girl
And what she said
Was something beautiful
To give your love
No matter what
And what she said

[Chorus]
I love all of you
Hurt by the cold
So hard and lonely too
When you don't know yourself



Coffee Shop - One Hot Minute - 1995

[Verse 1]
I am just a lousy bum
Searching for the unknown crumb
The crumb, the crumb
Something or someone to come
Come along illuminate my lust
Combust
Confucius might have been confused
And Buddha might have blown a fuse
I ooze the muse

[Chorus]
Meet me at the coffee shop
We can dance like Iggy Pop
Another go in the parking lot
Frewak the cheek on your hot spot

[Verse 2]
Back and forth my body's jerking
Will to thrill will not stop working
Work and work
I'll take you on a honeymoon
Jumping on a bed in a hotel room
The room, the groom

[Chorus]
Meet me at the coffee shop
We can dance like Iggy Pop
Another go in the parking lot
Frewak the cheek on your hot spot

Meet me at the coffee shop
We can dance like Iggy Pop
Another go in the parking lot
Frewak the cheek on your hot spot



Pea - One Hot Minute - 1995

[Verse]
I'm a little pea
I love the sky and the trees
I'm a teeny, tiny little ant
Checking out this and that

And I am nothing
Ah, so you have nothing to hide

And I'm a pacifist
So I can fuck your shit up
Oh yeah, I'm small
Oh yeah, I'm small

Fuck you asshole
You homophobic, redneck dick
Big and tough and macho
You can kick my ass

[Outro]
So fucking what?
So fucking what?
So fucking what?
So fucking what?



One Big Mob - One Hot Minute - 1995

[Verse 1]
I am you are me [x4]
Good woman said you've got to believe
Submerge into the urge of we
Deliciously the mystery

[Chorus]
One big mob, oh yeah, oh yeah[x2]
Ek bara mala, oh yeah, oh yeah[x2]

[Verse 2]
Ooze into into my noodle
East or west shepherd or poodle
Ladybug pine tree
To mingle with the bumblebee
A lover to the sun
And a brother to the cool breeze

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Scrawled upon the wall
Of a bathroom stall
A stranger wrote a note
That spoke to all
One, two, buckle my shoe
Take care of me
Because I might be you

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
We live in the city
We live in the jungle
It's time to be drinking
A thimble humble


Everything you ever see
Is never more than you and me
Give it on in to the beauty of the mystery
One big mob in one big home
A broken home
I'd like to share some air with you
Some air with you
A morning forest full of truths
The green is blue
The head that's getting pregnant lives
To give and give


What was I thinking in my head
The color red
Breaking hearts instead of bread
Something I said
Checkmated by frustration
Need to be cut loose
A different kind of being lost
A sullen cost

[Outro]
Pica-boo street
In Timbuktu
Do I need to repeat
That a boy
Named Sue
Rocking to the beat
Of the kangaroo
Let me kiss your feet
And your forehead too



Walkabout - One Hot Minute - 1995

I think I'll go on a walkabout
And find out what it's all about
And that ain't hard
Just me and my own two feet, in the heat
I got myself to meet
A detective of perspective
I need to try and get a bigger eye
Open wide
Bloodwood flowers in my gaze
Walkabout in the sunny days
Do me now
On a walkabout

You can do it in the city, you can do it in a zone
You can do it in a desert
You can do the unknown
On a walkabout

High desert skies are what I spy
So fly, you gotta wonder why, hm
The stingrays must be fat this year
Are moving slow in my lowest gear
The didgeridoo original man with a dream
I believe the Aborigine
On a walkabout

You could do it with a shuffle, you could do it with a stroll
You could do it with a stride
You could do the unknown
On a walkabout

A walk could cure most all my blues
Bare feet or in my two shoes
One...two...

I think I'll go on a walkabout
And find out what it's all about
Can't hurt to try
Use your legs to rock it wide
Take a ride to the other side



Tearjerker - One Hot Minute - 1995

Could you turn up the track a little bit please?

My mouth fell open
Hoping that the truth
Would not be true
Refuse the news

I'm feeling sick now
What the fuck am I
Supposed to do
Just lose and lose

First time I saw you
You were sitting
Backstage in a dress
A perfect mess

You never knew this
But I wanted badly for you to
Requite my love

Left on the floor
Leaving your body
When highs are the lows
And lows are the way
So hard to stay
Guess now you know
I love you so

I liked your whiskers
And I liked the
Dimple in your chin
Your pale blue eyes

You painted pictures
Cause the one
That hurts
Can give so much
You gave me such

Left on the floor
Leaving your body
When highs are the lows
And lows are the way
So hard to stay
Guess now you know
I love you so



One Hot Minute - One Hot Minute - 1995

[Verse 1]
I was riding
Riding on my bike
Me with my friend
We're so alike

[Chorus 1]
Am I all alone

[Verse 2]
She said all we
Have is this
We just had to stop
And share a kiss

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
One hot minute
And I'm in it come and get it [x3]
If I chase it
I might waste it
Come and spit it

[Chorus 1] [x2]

[Verse 3]
Sitting in the fire
Get along and have some fun
Floating to be higher
Maybe I'm your special one
Silent testifier
Breathe the moon
And eat the sun
Sitting in the fire

A tiny wink is all
All we have
No it's not much more
But don't get mad

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 4]
Close your eyes
And click your heels
Can you believe
How good it feels

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Outro]
Three lbs. of love
Inside my skull
A million more lives
It's never dull
Just a few times spun
Spun around the sun
A couple more or less
And then we're done



Falling Into Grace - One Hot Minute - 1995

[Verse 1]
What ever never knew
That I could feel so good
Smile in your eyes
What ever never knew
That I could walk through wood
I guess I never tried
A million years old
But just a little girl
Vibing off the gong
Rubbing on the bowls
Make you float around
Make your loving strong

[Pre-Chorus]
And when we get
In the same place
At the same time
It is your grace
That I want to
Fall right into now
To love avow

[Chorus]
I'm falling into grace with you
I'm falling into gurumukh
I'm falling into grace with you
I'm falling into gurumukh

[Verse 2]
She moves in a rapture
That her capsule might
Land on your star
Meditating in the morning
Head dressed in white
Beauty bazaar

You can smell the purple light
Coming from her heart
Get lost and wet
I treat you like a teacher
Because that's what you are
I want to be your pet

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus][x3]



Shallow Be Thy Game - One Hot Minute - 1995

[Verse 1]
I was not created in the likeness of a fraud
Your hell is something scary, I prefer a loving God
We are not the center of this funny universe
And what is worse, I do not serve in fear of such a curse

[Verse 2]
Shallow be thy game, 2000 years, look in the mirror
You play the game of shame and tell your people live in fear
A rival to the way you see, the Bible let him be
I'm a threat to your survival and your control company

[Chorus]
You'll never burn me [x2]
I will be your heretic
You can't contain me
I am the power free
Truth belongs to everybody

[Verse 3]
To anyone who's listening, you're not born into sin
The guilt they try and give you, puke it in the nearest bin
Missionary madness sweep up culture with a broom
Trashing ancient ways is part for the course it's fucking rude

[Verse 4]
To think that you're above, the laws of nature is a joke
Purple sashes, feeding masses, smoke on which to choke
I might be a monkey when it comes to being holy
Fundamental hatred get down on your knees and...

[Chorus]
You'll never burn me [x2]
I will be your heretic
You can't contain me
I am the power free
Truth belongs to everybody

[Verse 1]
I was not created in the likeness of a fraud
Your hell is something scary, I prefer a loving God
We are not the center of this funny universe
And what is worse, I do not serve in fear of such a...

[Chorus]
You'll never burn me [x2]
I will be your heretic
You can't contain me
I am the power free

Transcending - One Hot Minute - 1995

[Verse 1]
You are my God, you are my dog
You kept me close, love never lost
I called you hippie, you said fuck off
Said your brother's a real punk rocker

[Chorus]
Something's going to happen
Something very soon
Transcending flesh could be a breeze
Sending me over the Moon

[Verse 2]
Friends near death, you gave respect
Sympathetic Intellect
Choices are, for one and all
All we are is, leaves that fall
(That's all)

[Bridge 1]
Always be loving you
Now I'm away from you
Always be loving you

[Verse 3]
Round and round inside your head
Smartest fucker I ever met
Vicious fish bit at your toes
Made you lie and numb your soul

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Mule donkey ass you bore the load
Of all creation's tortured souls
Choices are, for one and all
All we are is, leaves that fall
Like no other, I love you, you're my brother [x6]

[Bridge 2]
Water flowing, and I will drink it
I will drink for you
A part of me left, that only you knew
Will never be understood
Will never be understood

[Outro]
Hey, gone to stay
Entire lifetime flash before me
In a loving stream
Hey Mother May I have lost a child
But she gave birth
To a loving stream

Ooh, never know
When the gods will come and
Take you
To a loving stream
Ooh, heart of gold
The most special things you gave me were
From your loving stream
In a loving stream

Fuck the magazines
Fuck the green machine
See the human being
In a loving stream
Fuck the legal greed
Fuck the nothing scene
See the family
In a loving stream



Let's Make Evil - One Hot Minute - 1995

[Verse 1]
Let's make evil
Let's make good
I'd do anything I could
Just to get you in my dirt word
Go down on you
Seventeen and thirty-one
I am just my mother's son
Brown eyes and a silver tongue
All the mothers come undone
At the sight of me

[Chorus]
The water's falling clear
Interiors decieve i fear
I think I'll kiss my shame away
My prudence is not dear
Inside out and feeling weird
I think I'll kiss my shame away

[Verse 2]
Let's get soft
Let's get hard
Let's get off in my backyard
Where the desert wind
Will wash our skin
A lighter red
Let's make peace
Let's make war
Let's break into heaven for
A dance with heaven's devils or
Is that more than you can store
Inside your head

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I don't want to live alone
Get on my throne
Slay my shame[x2]

[Verse 3]
Let's get gentle
Let's get pissed
Get your knickers in a twist
Cause the angel and the devil kiss
They fell in love
Some seem dirty
Some say clean
Something from a madman's dream
Am I really what I seem?
Rising to my head like cream
It feels so strange

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Slay my shame[x2]
I don't want to live alone
Get on my throne
Slay my shame[x2]



Stretch You Out - One Hot Minute - 1995

[Verse 1]
Stretching out your tightness
Good enough to make you grow
We are all in favor of this motion

Stretching out your tightness
Time to open up your hole
When it rains, I let myself get wet

I have always wanted to
Give something to my brother
Proposing to expose your head
Just something that is like no other

[Chorus]
I'll stretch you out
I'll stretch you out, my friend
I'll stretch you out

[Verse 2]
The juice that flows from intuition
Is my liquid fare
We are all in favor of the open end

Three pounds of love and knowledge
Are expanding in my skull
Truth be told, we let the good times roll

I have always needed to
Receive it and believe it
And it's making and creating love
Tender titillation

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I'm a fish and I can swim all day
I can swim in so many ways
Make it up as I go along
That way it is never wrong

I'm a bird and I can fly away
I can shift in so many shapes
Make it up as I go along
That way it is never wrong
Owwwwwwww....

[Bridge]
There's a glowing up around the moon
It is showing
We want to play in the water that is flowing

[Verse 4]
Very legendary
Extra planetary fairy
Varied truths, she's making just for you

Yes I have always wanted to
Give something to the stranger
M-m-m-moving to improve the groove
A mental transformation

[Chorus]



Bob - One Hot Minute - 1995

Well, my friend Bob's in jail today
His girlfriend is too
For stealing change for gasoline

Nothing to do but rue
Destroy the bruise (???)
'Cause there will never be another one just like you, no
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob…

I met him on the boulevard, Hollywood and Vine
He said, "You're gonna be a superstar"
I said, "That's fine, sublime"
He loved my crime

But there will never be another one just like you, no
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob...
I never see you
I never see you
I never see you

**something something** all through the night
Blackest flag at dawn
A lust for life that kills itself before it gets too strong, that's wrong
Please be lifelong

'Cause there will never be another one just like you, no
Bob…
I never see you
I never see you
I never see you

Killing yourself, that would be an awesome oath
This song is so far away (???)
Remember the home and how they left us alone (???)
Remember our friendship

Stealing everything in the store
You know I want you to stay
Remember the home and how they left us alone (???)
Friends fade away…

Well, my friend Bob's insane today
I know I am too
The mental patients laugh and cry

Nothing to do but rue
Destroy the bruise (???)
'Cause there will never be another one just like you, no
Bob…



Melancholy Mechanics - One Hot Minute - 1995

[Verse 1]
Persistant mist that faults my vision
Phsyco-exist point of collision

[Chorus]
It's raining in my cranium
My head feels like a stadium

[Verse 2]
3 pound of grey
About to burst
Inside my 3 pound
Universe

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
These are the melancholy mechanics of my mind[x2]

[Verse 3]
Symbols I've been given to express my goal
Always come up short
You know they just don't get that low

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

[Verse 4]
Quick release chemicals strike with incomprehensible precision
Biorganic electronics targeting microscopic destinations of devistation

[Outro]
Cleaner than light
Meaner than a laser fight in the night 2000
Billions of micro maniacs unknown to most as the uncontrollable soldiers of suffering succotash
Instantaneous infiltration leaves me with a case of bustation, frustration
Alone in the constellation of alienation detached from empty conversation
I wait[x2]
For the wave to break



Circle Of The Noose - One Hot Minute - 1995

[Verse 1]
Inspiration
Messed me up
Makes me cry
Come and see me please
Dragonfly, so I don't die
Inner circle, break my heart so I can stop

[Chorus]
All I need is for bone and for free
All I need, all I need
I don't need it
Don't need it
I don't need it

[Verse 2]
Locomotives
Shoot me up
Shoot me down
Devastation boy
Deal me out
Steal my joy
Good for nothing
That's the one, my mother's song

[Chorus]
All I need is for bone and for free
All I need, all I need
I don't need it
Don't need it
'Neath the salt and the sea
Like for fun, yeah for free

[Verse 3]
Dogs are laughing
Laughing now that I know how
Human human form
I'm so warm inside this stone

[Chorus]
All I need is for bone and for free
All I need, all I need
All I need is for bone and for free
All I need, all I need
I don't need it
Don't need it
I don't need it



Around The World - Californication - 1999

[Verse 1]
All around the world, we could make time
Rompin' and a-stompin' 'cause I'm in my prime
Born in the North and sworn to entertain ya
'Cause I'm down for the state of Pennsylvania

I try not to whine, but I must warn ya
'Bout the motherfuckin' girls from California
Alabama baby said "Hallelujah"
Good God, girl, I wish I knew ya

[Chorus]
I know, I know for sure
That life is beautiful around the world
I know, I know it's you
You say "Hello" and then I say "I do"

[Verse 2]
Come back baby, 'cause I'd like to say
I've been around the world, back from Bombay
Fox hole love, pie in your face
Living in and out of a big fat suitcase

Bonafide ride, step aside, Mike Johnson
Yes I could, in the woods of Wisconsin
Wake up the cake, it's a lake she's kissin' me
As they do when they do in Sicily

[Chorus]
I know, I know for sure
That life is beautiful around the world
I know, I know it's you
You say "Hello" and then I say "I do"

[Verse 3]
Where you want to go, who you want to be
What you want to do, just come with me
I saw God and I saw the fountains
You and me girl, sitting in the Swiss mountains

Me Oh My O, me and Guy O
Freer than a bird 'cause we're rocking Ohio
Around the world, I feel dutiful
Take a wife 'cause life is beautiful

[Chorus]
I know, I know for sure
Ding, dang, dong, dong, deng, deng, dong, dong, ding, dang
I know, I know it's you
Ding, dang, dong, dong, deng, deng, dong, dong, ding, dang

Mother Russia, do not suffer, I know you're bold enough
I've been around the world and I have seen your love
I know, I know it's you
You say "Hello" and then I say "I do"



Parallel Universe - Californication - 1999

[Verse 1]
Deep inside of a parallel universe
It's getting harder and harder
To tell what came first
Under water where thoughts
Can breathe easily
Far away you were made
In a sea
Just like me

[Chorus]
Christ I'm a sidewinder
I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere
It's everything

[Verse 2]
Staring straight up into the sky
Oh my my
A solar system that fits
In your eye
Microcosm

You could die but you're never dead
Spider web
Take a look at the stars in your head
Fields of space kid

[Chorus]
Christ I'm a sidewinder
I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere
It's everything

[Chorus]
Christ I'm a sidewinder
I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere
It's everything

[Verse 3]
Psychic changes are born in your heart
Entertain
A nervous breakthrough that makes us the same
Bless your heart girl
Kill the pressure it's raining on
Salty cheeks
When you hear the beloved song
I am with you

[Chorus]
Christ I'm a sidewinder
I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere
It's everything



Scar Tissue - Californication - 1999

[Verse 1]
Scar tissue that I wish you saw
Sarcastic mister know-it-all
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
'Cause with the birds I'll share

[Chorus]
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'

[Verse 2]
Push me up against the wall
Young Kentucky girl in a push-up bra
Fallin' all over myself
To lick your heart and taste your health, 'cause

With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'

A southern girl with a scarlet drawl
Wave good-bye to Ma and Pa,
'Cause with the birds I'll share

[Chorus]
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'

[Verse 4]
Soft spoken with a broken jaw
Step outside but not to brawl and
Autumn's sweet we call it fall
I'll make it to the moon if I have to crawl and

[Chorus]
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely view

Scar tissue that I wish you saw
Sarcastic mister know-it-all
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you

With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
With the birds I'll share this lonely view

Otherside - Californication - 1999

[Chorus]
How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side
I don’t, I don’t believe it’s bad
Slit my throat, it’s all I ever

[Verse 1]
I heard your voice through a photograph
I thought it up it brought up the past
Once you know you can never go back
I’ve got to take it on the otherside
Centuries are what it meant to me
A cemetery where I marry the sea
Stranger things could never change my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
I’ve got to take it on the otherside
Take it on the otherside
Take it on
Take it on

[Chorus]
How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side
I don’t, I don’t believe it’s bad
Slit my throat, it’s all I ever

[Verse 2]
Pour my life into a paper cup
The ashtray's full and I’m spillin' my guts
She wants to know am I still her slut
I’ve got to take it on the otherside
A scarlet starlet and she’s in my bed
A candidate for my soul mate bled
Push the trigger and pull the thread

[Pre-Chorus]
I’ve got to take it on the otherside
Take it on the otherside
Take it on
Take it on

[Chorus]
How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side
I don’t, I don’t believe it’s bad
Slit my throat, it’s all I ever

[Bridge]
Turn me on, take me for a hard ride
Burn me out, leave me on the otherside
I yell and tell it that it’s not my friend
I tear it down, I tear it down and then it’s born again

[Chorus]
How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side
I don’t, I don’t believe it’s bad
Slit my throat, it’s all I ever
How long
I don’t, I don’t believe it’s sad
Slit my throat, it’s all I ever

The life of a wife swapper
Come with me ’cause I’m a big bopper

Exterminate my cause
You want to draw some straws
Be the one to see my flaws
Make me bleed with painted claws

Complications of a mastermind
Last temptation of my kind
Extra planetary sign
When do we align
All in time
Right on

[Instrumental Break]

Californication - Californication - 1999

[Verse 1]
Psychic spies from China try to steal your mind's elation
An' little girls from Sweden dream of silver screen quotation
An' if you want these kind of dreams, it's Californication
It's the edge of the world an' all of Western civilization
The sun may rise in the east at least it's settled in a final location
It's understood that Hollywood sells Californication

[Pre-Chorus]
Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of agin'
Celebrity skin, is this your chin or is that war you're wagin'?
First born unicorn
Hardcore, soft porn

[Chorus]
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

[Verse 2]
Marry me, girl, be my fairy to the world, be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with the baby inside gettin' high on information
An' buy me a star on the boulevard, it's Californication
Space may be the final frontier but it's made in a Hollywood basement
An', Cobain, can you hear the spheres singing songs off Station to Station?
An' Alderaan's not far away, it's Californication

[Pre-Chorus]
Born and raised by those who praise control of population
Well, everybody's been there and I don't mean no vacation
First born unicorn
Hardcore, soft porn

[Chorus]
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Destruction leads to a very rough road but it also breeds creation
An' earthquakes are to a girl's guitar that's just another good vibration
An' tidal waves couldn't save the world from Californication

[Pre-Chorus]
Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of agin'
Sicker than the rest, there is no test but this is what you're cravin'
First born unicorn
Hardcore, soft porn

[Chorus]
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication



Easily - Californication - 1999

[Verse 1]
Easily let's get carried away
Easily let's get married today

[Bridge 1]
Shao Lin shouted a rose from his throat
Everything must go
A licking stick is thicker when you break it to show
Everything must go

[Chorus 1]
The story of a woman on the morning of a war
Remind me, if you will, exactly what we're fighting for
Calling and calling for something in the air
Calling and calling I know you must be there

[Verse 2]
Easily let's get caught in a wave
Easily we won't get caught in a cage

[Bridge 2]
Shao Lin shakin' for the sake of his soul
Everything must go
Lookin' mighty tired of all the things that you own
Everything must go

[Chorus 2]
I can't tell you who to idolize
You think it's almost over but it's only on the rise
Calling, calling, from something in the air
Calling, calling, I know you must be there

[Chorus 1]
The story of a woman on the morning of a war
Remind me, if you will, exactly what we're fighting for
Throw me to the wolves because there's order in the pack
Throw me to the sky because I know I'm coming back

[Bridge 2]
Shao Lin shakin' for the sake of his soul
Everything must go
Lookin' mighty tired of all the things that you own

Remind me, if you will, exactly what we're fighting for
Calling and calling for something in the air
Calling and calling I know you must be there

I don't want to be your little research monkey boy
The creature that I am is only going to destroy
Throw me to the wolves because there's order in the pack
Throw me to the sky because I know you're coming back



Porcelain - Californication - 1999

[Chorus 1]
Porcelain
Are you wasting away in your skin
Are you missing the love of your kin
Drifting and floating and fading away

[Verse 1]
Porcelain
Do you smell like a girl when you smile?
Can you bear not to share with your child?
Drifting and floating and fading away

[Chorus 2]
Little lune
All day
Little lune

[Verse 2]
Porcelain
Do you carry the moon in your womb?
Someone said that you're fading too soon
Drifting and floating and fading away

Porcelain
Are you wasting away in your skin
Are you missing the love of your kin
Nodding and melting and fading away

Little lune
All day

Emit Remmus - Californication - 1999

The California animal is a bear
Angeleno, but the devil may care
Summer time to talk and swear
Later maybe we could share some air
I’ll take you to the movies there
We could walk through Leicester square
What could be wetter than
An English girl, American man

London in the summer time
Call me now use the satellite
London in the summer time
Cuss me out and it’ll feel all right

Hesitate but don’t refuse
The choice was yours but you said choose
The look she used was green and sharp
Stabbed that boy all in his heart
Come what may the cosmos will
Take me up and down on primrose hill
What could be wetter than
An English girl, American man

London in the summer time
Call me now use the satellite
London in the summer time
Cuss me out and it’ll feel all right

Cuss me out and it’ll feel all right
It’s all right now
Call me now use the satellite
It’s all right
It’s all right

Down and out and it’ll sound all right
It’s all right now
It’s all right

The California flower is poppy, child
Felony sends me all the gold in your smile
Drift away from anyone you can
Nothing ever goes according to plan
Though I know that every river bends
Time to say hello to snow on the Thames
What could be wetter than
An English girl, American man

London in the summer time
Call me now use the satellite
London in the summer time
Cuss me out and it’ll feel all right

This Velvet Glove - Californication - 1999

Close to my skin, I'm falling in
Someone who's been
Sittin' by the phone, I'm left alone
In another zone

John says to live above hell
My will is well
No one is waiting for me to fail
My will could sail, yeah

It's such a waste to be wasted in the first place
I want to taste the taste
Of being face to face with common grace
To meditate on the warmest dream
And when I walk alone I listen to our secret theme

[Hook]
Your solar eyes are like nothing I have ever seen
Somebody closer can see right through
I'd take a fall and you know that I'd do anything
I will for you

Sailin' for the sun, cause there is one
Knows where I'm from
I care for you, I really do
I really do

Come closer now so you can lie
Right by my side
Sit alone in the sun, I wrote a letter to you
Getting over myself

Your solar eyes are like nothing I have ever seen
Somebody closer can see right through
I’d take a fall and you know that I’d do anything
I will for you

Your solar eyes are like nothing I have ever seen
Somebody close that was made for you
I’d take a fall and you know that I’d do anything
I will for you

Close to my skin, someone who's been
I'm a-falling in
Disasters are just another star
Falling in my yard

John says to live above hell
My will is well
Long to be with someone to tell
I love your smell



Savior - Californication - 1999

[Verse 1]
Dusting off your savior
Well, you were always my favorite, always my man
All in a hand
To celebrate you is greater now that I can
Always my man

[Verse 2]
Now you see what I came for
No one here is to blame for, misunderstand
All in a hand
Just like you cause you made me all that I am
All in a hand

[Chorus 1]
A butterfly that flaps its wings
Affecting almost everything
The more I hear the orchestra
The more I have something to bring
And now I see you
In a beautiful and different light
He's just a man
And any damage done will be all right
Call out my name
Call and I came

[Verse 3]
Dusting off your savior
Forgiving any behavior, he's just a man
All in a hand
Your hero's destined to waver, anyone can
Always my man

[Verse 4]
I would never betray you
Look at me who could raise you, face in the sand
Safe in your hand
You were always my favorite, always my man
All in a hand

[Chorus 2]
We are the Red Hots
And we're loving up the love-me-nots
The flowers in your flower pots
Are dancing on the table tops
And now I see you
In a beautiful and different light
He's just a man
And everything he does will be alright
Call out my name
Call and I came

[Outro]
Dusting off your savior
The life that you have narrated
You were my man

[Instrumental]



Purple Stain - Californication - 1999

To finger paint is not a sin
I put my middle finger in
Your monthly blood is what I win
I'm in your house now let me spin

Python power straight from Monty
Celluloid loves got a John Frusciante
Spread your head and spread the blanket
She's too free and I'm the patient

Black and white a red and blue
Things that look good on you
And if I scream don't let me go
A purple stain I know

Knock on wood we all stay good
Cause we all live in Hollywood
With Dracula and Darla Hood
Unspoken words were understood

Up to my ass in alligators
Let's get it on with the alligator haters
Did what you did, did what you said
What's the point yo what's the spread

Black and white a red and blue
Things that look good on you
And if I scream don't let me go
A purple stain I know
And if I call for you to stay
Come hit the funk on your way
It's way out there but I don't care
Cause this is where I go

Knock on wood we all stay good
Cause we all live in Hollywood
With Dracula and Darla Hood
Unspoken words were understood

It's way out there
But I dont care
Cause this is what
I want to wear
Knock on wood we all stay good
Cause we all live in Hollywood

To finger paint is not a sin
I put my middle finger in
Your monthly blood is what I win
I'm in your house now let me spin

Feather light but you can't move this
Farley is an angel and I can prove this
Purple is a stain upon my pillow
Let's sleep weeping willow

Black and white a red and blue
Things that look good on you
And if I scream don't let me go
A purple stain I know
And if I call for you to stay
Come hit the funk on your way
It's way out there but I don't care
Cause this is where I go

Knock on wood we all stay good
Cause we all live in Hollywood
With Dracula and Darla Hood
Unspoken words were understood

It's way out there
But I don't care
Cause this is what
I want to wear
Knock on wood we all stay good
Cause we all live in Hollywood



Right On Time - Californication - 1999

[Verse 1]
One shot all I need
I've got rhythm when I bleed
Until death do us part
Break my heart so I can start

Supercalifragilistic
Kiss me in the futuristic
Twisted but I must insist
It's time to get on top of this

[Chorus]
It's right on time
It's right on time
It's right on time
It's right on time
It's right on time
It's right on time
Looking fine, you're looking fine, get on 1999
It's right on time

[Verse 2]
Discard to bombard
Calling all you shooting stars
Holy cow, bow wow wow
Now I'm here I'm nowhere now

Joan of Arc reincarnated
Maybe we could be related
So much blood to circulate
And so much space to decorate

[Chorus]
It's right on time
It's right on time
It's right on time
It's right on time
It's right on time
It's right on time
Looking fine, you're looking fine, get on 1999
It's right on time

(It's right on time
It's right on time
It's right on time
It's right on time
It's right on time
It's right on time
It's right on time
It's right on time)

[Verse 3]
Plain and simple pain
I want to but I can't complain
Death row let us go
It's time to blow up for the show

All the world reverberated
Coming through we motorcaded
Vibrate when we operated
Turning up in solid stated

[Outro]
Oh Lord!



Road Trippin' - Californication - 1999

Road trippin’ with my two favorite allies
Fully loaded we got snacks and supplies
It’s time to leave this town
It’s time to steal away
Let’s go get lost
Anywhere in the U.S.A
Let’s go get lost
Let’s go get lost

Blue you sit so pretty
West of the one
Sparkles light with yellow icing
Just a mirror for the sun
Just a mirror for the sun
Just a mirror for the sun

These smiling eyes are just a mirror for

So much as come before those battles lost and won
This life is shining more forever in the sun
Now let us check our heads
And let us check the surf
Staying high and dry’s
More trouble than it’s worth
In the sun

Just a mirror for the sun
Just a mirror for the sun
Just a mirror for the sun

These smiling eyes are just a mirror for

In Big Sur we take some time to linger on
We three hunky dory’s got our snakefinger on
Now let us drink the stars
It’s time to steal away
Let’s go get lost
Right here in the U.S.A
Let’s go get lost
Let’s go get lost

Blue you sit so pretty
West of the one
Sparkles light with yellow icing
Just a mirror for the sun
Just a mirror for the sun
Just a mirror for the sun

These smiling eyes are just a mirror for
These smiling eyes are just a mirror for
Your smiling eyes are just a mirror for



Quixoticelixer - Californication - 1999

[Chorus 1]
Kick back a little bit just to watch and see
Getting sicker by the minute with debauchery
Whatever your pleasure, I'm your punk
On the brink of sinking, but not yet sunk
How I listen below when you told me
That I was all you had to hold
I wish it was so when you told me
That you were solid gold

[Verse 1]
Gravity-free is she, look at her
Hottest on the map she's full of anti-matter
You never look at very mellow impressions
Smell you with your going-to-hell expression
Quixoticelixer might
But it will probably not fix your bite
Tell me now, tell me how
Did I your lipstick on my kite

[Chorus 2]
I love this weather
It's the perfect storm
Just keep it coming
In its perfect form
I love this weather
Because it keeps me warm
Just keep it coming
In its perfect form

[Verse 2]
Everyday depression in a beautiful dress
Lady made a beautiful mess I guess
Dedicated mind did a medicated state
Is a highly overrated fate
Terra-bulb is a soul
When she told me there is such a thing
Did you know that you glow when you go
From winter to the spring

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 3]
The madder the boy, the sadder the song
That's a wicked fate but the sick gets strong
Mad boy, sad song
A wicked fate, but the sick gets strong
Nobody's right and everyone's wrong
Got to fuse to bop for all day long
Mad boy, sad song
Wicked fate but the sick gets

[Chorus 1]

[Outro]
I swear to god I could not hurt you
I've got to be inside your virtue
I can't contain my urge to search you
I stand before you there's no curfew
I long to be inside your virtue
My heart is swollen when I search you
I swear to god I could not hurt you
My heart is swollen when I search you
I swear to god I could not hurt you
I swear to god I could not hurt you
I've got to be inside your virtue
I can't contain my urge to search you



Fat Dance - Californication - 1999

[Pre-Chorus][x4]
Do a fat dance[x2]
Do a, do a, do a fat dance

[Chorus 1]
One reason why I got you for
A woman is that you can do the moveable
Kitchen or bedroom or bathroom floor
Keep it moving because I need the hardcore

[Pre-Chorus][x2]

[Chorus 2]
Soft, she's off and left
Now I'm coming
I'm feeling in the ghetto because that's my trouble

[Pre-Chorus][x4]

[Verse 1]
Another reason why I love your ass
Your dancing like everyday could be your last
Do you, do you, do you want to dance
Lets get it on like black trash

[Pre-Chorus][x2]

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 2]
I met her on the school yard and
She was such a cool card
She took me for a fool
Because I acted like a bodyguard
Oh Yohanna love, my Yohanna love
She was just the cutest thing
My God, that I have ever seen
Tearing up my seratonin
Messing with my dopamine
Oh Yohanna love, my Yohanna love
Just about the time
That I was feeling smart again
She walked into the room
Wearing nothing but a cardigan
Oh Yohanna love, my Yohanna love
She knew what she was doing
When she told me no she would
Never let the perfect message
In and get the perfect screwing
Oh Yohanna love, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus][x2]

[Bridge]
Number three reasons why I'm in your house
Hot butter melts across your mouth
Dancing and a dancing, And a dancing machine
Somebody move, Somebody scream
Yeah

[Chorus 1]



Over Funk - Californication - 1999

[Verse 1]
Please start dirty
It’s 7:30
Loss of mind and
Cat alertly
My best, your rest
Send your call
And then I nest
Perversity in features
Adversity that teaches
Some call love more
Soon I’ll call the rhythm song

[Chorus]
It’s over
It’s over now
So long to doo-doo-ra
It’s over
It’s over now
I dare not get a look

[Verse 2]
Be yourself
Some let her call
Never fall
See yourself
Sit alone and wait
To my own call
Go ballistic
Anarchistic
Smack my mouth and
Then you kissed it
So long, my gun
Simple run and
Letter bum
Things are looking good on paper
Once when I was in your favor
This kiss from a mess
Send my girl riddle less

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
See yourself
Sad, alone and wait
To my own brawl
Free yourself
There’s an only count
This stands for all of them
Just play at any tempo
Going mad and going mental
All balm, said no
Just to let him put it wrong

[Chorus]



Gong Li - Californication - 1999

Some people say you hate me
I don’t believe it’s true, things that you’re going through
Some people say you hate me
I don’t believe it’s you, things that you’re going through
Some people said I pray for
No one you want to live, the eyes that once were his
Some people sad I pray for
The way you want to live, the eyes you want to give

Some people say you played me
I don’t care if it’s true, I’m waiting here for you
Some people say you made it
I’m not afraid to know, when things are getting low
Some people say you hate me
I don’t believe it’s true, things that you’re going through
Some people say you hate me
I don’t believe it’s you, things that you’re going through



By The Way - By The Way - 2002

[Chorus]
Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for
Dani the girl is singing songs to me
Beneath the marquee, overload

[Verse 1]
Steak knife, card shark
Con job, boot cut
Skin that flick, she's such a little DJ
To get there quick by street but not the freeway
Turn that trick to make a little leeway
Beat that nic, but not the way that we play
Dogtown, blood bath
Rib cage, soft tail

[Chorus]
Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for

[Verse 2]
Black jack, dope dick
Pawn shop, quick pick
Kiss that dyke, I know you want to hold one
Not on strike but I'm about to bowl one
Bite that mic, I know you never stole one
Girls that like a story, so I told one
Song bird, main line
Cash back, hard top

[Chorus]
Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for
Dani the girl is singing songs to me
Beneath the marquee, oversold
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for

[Bridge]
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah

[Chorus]
Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for
Dani the girl is singing songs to me
Beneath the marquee, oversold
By the way, I tried to say
I know you from before

[Outro]
Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for



Universally Speaking - By The Way - 2002

[Verse 1]
I saw your face
Elegant and tired
Cut up from the chase
Still I so admire
Blood shot your smile
Delicate and wild
Give me she-wolf style
Rip right through me

[Pre-Chorus]
Silveretta, the jets of a lifetime
Go and get her, I got her on my mind
Nothing better, the feeling is so fine
Simply put, I saw your love stream flow

[Chorus]
Come on baby, 'cause there's no name for
Give it up and I got what I came for
Universally speaking
I take it back and you make me nervous
Nothing better than love and service
Universally speaking
I win in the long run

[Verse 2]
I saw your crying
Dying to get high
Two of a kind
It's our hands tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Silveretta, the jets of a lifetime
Go and get her, I got her on my mind
All the better, to make it so fine
Simply put, I saw your love stream flow

[Chorus]
Come on baby, 'cause there's no name for
Give it up and I got what I came for
Universally speaking
I take it back and you make me nervous
Nothing better than love and service
Universally speaking
I win in the long run

[Outro]
Silveretta, the jets of a lifetime
Go and get her I got her on my mind
Nothing better, the feeling is so fine
Simply put I saw your love stream flow
Simply put I saw your love stream flow
Let's go



This Is The Place - By The Way - 2002

This is the place where all the junkies go
Where time gets fast but everything gets slow
Can I get some Vaseline?
Step into a modern scene
Take a chance on that which seems to be the making of a dream

I don't wanna do it like my daddy did
I don't wanna give it to my baby's kid

[Hook]
This is my calling, I said my darling
Shocking, appalling all I can do to you
Hammers are falling, I said my darling
Shocking, appalling all I can do to you

This is the place where all the devils plead
Their case to take from you what they need
Can I isolate your gene?
Can I kiss your dopamine?
In a way I wonder if she's living in a magazine

I don't wanna say it if it isn't so
I don't wanna weigh it but I've got to know

[Hook]

I saw you out there yesterday
What did you wanna say?
A perfect piece of DNA
Caught in a flashing ray

I caught you out there in the fray
What did you wanna say?
A master piece of DNA
Caught in a flashing ray

Can I smell your gasoline?
Can I pet your wolverine?
On the day my best friend died
I could not get my copper clean

I don't wanna take it up with little Joe
I don't wanna fake it but I've gotta know

[Hook]

I am a misfit
I'm born with all of it
The fucking ultimate
Of love inside the atom split
I'm in a flash ray
A mash of DNA
Another popping Jay
Who thinks he's got something to say



Dosed - By The Way - 2002

[Verse 1: Anthony Kieidis]
I got dosed by you and
Closer than most to you and
What am I supposed to do
Take it away I never had it anyway
Take it away and everything will be okay
In you a star is born and
You cut a perfect form and
Someone forever warm
Lay on lay on lay on lay on
Lay on lay on lay on lay on

[Chorus: Anthony Kieidis & John Frusciante]
Way upon the mountain where she died
All I ever wanted was your life
Deep inside the canyon I can't hide
All I ever wanted was your life

[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis]
Show love with no remorse and
Climb on to your seahorse and
This ride is right on course
This is the way I wanted it to be with you
This is the way that I knew that it would be with you
Lay on lay on lay on lay on
Lay on lay on lay on lay on

[Chorus: Anthony Kieidis & John Frusciante]
Way upon the mountain where she died
All I ever wanted was your life
Deep inside the canyon I can't hide
All I ever wanted was your life

[Verse 1 (Abridged): Anthony Kieidis]
I got dosed by you and
Closer than most to you and
What am I supposed to do
Take it away I never had it anyway
Take it away and everything will be okay

[Chorus: Anthony Kieidis & John Frusciante]
Way upon the mountain where she died
All I ever wanted was your life
Deep inside the canyon I can't hide
All I ever wanted was your life



Don't Forget Me - By The Way - 2002

[Verse 1]
I'm an ocean in your bedroom
Make you feel warm, make you want to re-assume
Now we know it all for sure
I'm a dance hall dirty breakbeat
Make the snow fall up from underneath your feet

[Pre-Chorus]
Not alone, I'll be there
Tell me when you want to go

[Verse 2]
I'm a meth lab, first rehab
Take it all off and step inside the running cab
There's a love that knows the way
I'm the rainbow in your jail cell
All the memories of everything you've ever smelled

[Pre-Chorus]
Not alone, I'll be there
Tell me when you want to go

[Chorus]
(Sideways falling
More will be revealed my friend)
Don't forget me, I can't hide it
Come again get me excited

[Verse 3]
I'm an inbred and a pothead
Two legs that you spread inside the tool shed
Now we know it all for sure
I could show you to the free field
Overcome and more will always be revealed
Not alone, I'll be there
Tell me when you want to go

[Chorus]
(Sideways fallin'
More will be revealed my friend)
Don't forget me, I can't hide it
Come again make me excited
(Sideways fallin'
More will be revealed my friend)
Don't forget me, I can't hide it
There’s a match, now let me light it

[Verse 4]
I'm the bloodstain on your shirt sleeve
Coming down and more are coming to believe
Now we know it all for sure
Make the hair stand up on your arm
Teach you how to dance inside the funny farm

[Pre-Chorus]
Not alone, I'll be there
Tell me when you want to go
I'll be there, tell me when you want to go
Comm'on in and tell me when you want to go
More will be revealed my friend



The Zephyr Song - By The Way - 2002

[Verse 1]
Can I get your hand to write on?
Just a piece of leg to bite on
What a night to fly my kite on
Do you want to flash a light on?
Take a look it's on display for you
Coming down, no not today

[Verse 2]
Did you meet your fortune teller?
Get it off with no propeller
Do it up, it's on with Stella
What a way to finally smell her
Picking up, but not too strong for you
Take a piece and pass it on

[Chorus]
Fly away on my zephyr
I feel it more than ever
And in this perfect weather
We'll find a place together
Fly on my wind

[Verse 3]
Rebel and a liberator
Find a way to be a skater
Rev it up to levitate her
Super friendly aviator
Take a look it's on display, for you
Coming down, no not today

[Chorus]
Fly away on my zephyr
I feel it more than ever
And in this perfect weather
We'll find a place together

[Post-Chorus]
In the water where I center my emotion
All the world can pass me by
Fly away on my Zephyr
We'll find a place together

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-woah, do you
Yea-yea-yea-yea-yea-yeah
Wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-woah, want to
Yea-yea-yea-yea-yea-yeah

[Chorus]
Fly away on my zephyr
I feel it more than ever
And in this perfect weather
We'll find a place together

[Post-Chorus]
In the water where I center my emotion
All the world can pass me by
Fly away on my Zephyr
We're going to live forever

Forever



Can't Stop - By The Way - 2002

[Verse 1]
Can't stop, addicted to the shindig
Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation
Defunkt, the pistol that you pay for
This punk, the feelin' that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
East side love is living on the West End
Knocked out, but, boy, you better come to
Don't die, you know, the truth as some do
Go write your message on the pavement
Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant
White heat is screamin' in the jungle
Complete the motion if you stumble
Go ask the dust for any answers
Come back strong with fifty belly dancers

[Chorus]
The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to

[Verse 2]
Sweetheart is bleeding in the snow cone
So smart, she's leadin' me to ozone
Music, the great communicator
Use two sticks to make it in the nature
I'll get you into penetration
The gender of a generation
The birth of every other nation
Worth your weight, the gold of meditation
This chapter's gonna be a close one
Smoke rings, I know you're gonna blow one
All on a spaceship, persevering
Use my hands for everything but steering
Can't stop the spirits when they need you
Mop tops are happy when they feed you
J. Butterfly is in the treetop
Birds that blow the meaning into bebop

[Chorus]
The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to

[Bridge]
Wait a minute, I'm passin' out win or lose, just like you
Far more shockin' than anything I ever knew, how about you?
Ten more reasons why I need somebody new, just like you
Far more shockin' than anything I ever knew, right on cue

[Verse 3]
Can't stop, addicted to the shindig
Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation
Defunct, the pistol that you pay for
This punk, the feelin' that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
East side love is living on the West End
Knocked out, but boy, you better come to
Don't die, you know, the truth is some do
Go write your message on the pavement
Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant
Kick start the golden generator
Sweet talk but don't intimidate her
Can't stop the gods from engineering
Feel no need for any interfering
Your image in the dictionary
This life is more than ordinary
Can I get two, maybe even three of these?
Comin' from the space to teach you of the Pleiades
Can't stop the spirits when they need you
This life is more than just a read-through



I Could Die for You - By The Way - 2002

[Verse 1]
Something inside the cards
I know is right
Don't want to live
Somebody else's life
This is what I want to be
And this is what I give to you
Because I get it free
She smiles while I do my time

I could die for you
Oh, this life I choose

[Verse 2]
I'm here to be your only go-between
To tell you of the sights
These eyes have seen
What I really want to do is
Turn it into motion
Beauty that I can't abuse
You know that I'd use my senses to
You can see that
It's only everywhere
I'd take it all and then
I'd find a way to share

[Pre-Chorus]
Come along and go
Along with me
Wander with me, Yo
It's all for free

[Chorus]
I could die for you
Whatcha wanna do
Oh, this life I choose
I could die for you
Whatcha wanna do
Oh, this life I choose

[Bridge]
Come again and tell me
Where you want to go
What it means for me
To be with you alone
Close the door and
No one has to know
How we are

[Pre-Chorus]
Come along and go
Along with me
Wander with me, Yo
It's all for free

[Chorus]
I could die for you
Whatcha wanna do
Oh, this life I choose
I could die for you
Whatcha wanna do
Oh, this life I choose

Make me wanna say

[Chorus]
I could die for you
Whatcha wanna do
Oh, this life I choose
I could die for you
Whatcha wanna do
Oh, this life I choose



Midnight - By The Way - 2002

[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
Things will never be the same
Still, I'm awfully glad I came
Resonating in the shape of things to come
Never waiting when I know there's only one
Messed it up, but rest assured
No one ever thinks they're cured
Just a minute while I reinvent myself
Make it up, and then I take it off the shelf

[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Over the laws of light
Over the moon by midnight
Let's do it all this time
Everyone wishing well we go, and…

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Everyone knows anything goes, and now
We are the lotus kids
Oh, better take note of this
For the story

[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis & John Frusciante]
The rising moon is on the shine
The blood of Scorpio's a nine
Like the fear that's in the eyes of every doe (aah-aah)
Say it now, 'cause John and Jane would like to know (aah-aah)
Is it safe inside your head?
Songs to serenade the dead
All along, I said I know no enemies
Mix it up until there are no pedigrees

[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Over the laws of light
Over the moon by midnight
Let's do it all this time
Everyone wishing well we go, and…

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Everyone knows anything goes, and now
We are the lotus kids
Oh, better take note of this
For the story

[Bridge: Anthony Kiedis]
Over the laws of light
Over the moon by midnight
Let's do it all this time
Into the shadow showing
Enter the rolling tide
Over the ocean so wide
Let's do it all this time
Everyone wishing well we go, and…

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Everyone knows anything goes, and now
We are the lotus kids
Oh, better take note of this
For the story
Everyone knows anything goes, and now
We are the loaded kids
Oh, better take note of this
For the story
Everyone knows anything goes, and now
We are the lotus kids
Oh, better take note of this
For the story



Throw Away Your Television - By The Way - 2002

Throw away your television
Time to make this clean decision
Master waits for its collision, now

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a repeat
Of a story told
It's a repeat
And it's getting old

Throw away your television
Make a break, big intermission
Re-create your supervision, now

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
Renegades with fancy gauges
Slay the plague for it's contagious
Pull the plug and take the stages

Take the noose off your ambition
Re-invent your intuition, now

Alleviate this ill condition now

It's a repeat

It's a repeat
It's a repeat



Cabron - By The Way - 2002

[Chorus]
Cabron, cabron
Cabron, cabron

[Verse 1]
I see you in the park
You're always wearing Dodger blue
Mad doggin' me and
Anyone from any other crew
I am small but I am strong
I'll get it on with you
If you want me to
What else can I do?
Everyone would take a cue
From anything you do
If you want them to
What else can they do?

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want to fight
I want to get along with you
This time of night's
For singing songs
About the local news

[Chorus]
Cabron, cabron
Cabron, cabron

[Verse 2]
I'll come around and make peace
Get down, have a barbeque
Let's keep the moon awake
And do electric boogaloo
I am small but I am strong
You see I'm just like you
If you only knew
That I'm just like you
All the world would
Take a cue from
Anything you do
If you only knew
That they're just like you

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want to fight
I want to get along with you
This time of night's
For singing songs
About the local news

I don't want to fight
I want to get along with you
This time of night's
For singing songs
About the local news

Cabron, cabron

If you want me to
What else can I do
'Cause I'm just like you
If you only knew

Tear - By The Way - 2002

[Verse 1]
This is my time
This is my tear
I can see clearly now
That this is not a place
For playing solitaire
Tell me where you want me
This is my time
This is my tear

[Verse 2]
Coming on strong
Baudelaire
Seems to me like
All the world gets high
When you take a dare
Let it rise before you
This is my crime

[Chorus]
All in all and I'm
Loving every rise and fall
The sun will make and I will take
Breath to be sure of this
In the end and then
All will be forgiven when
Surrender rises high and I
Gave what I came to give
Say it now because you never know

[Verse 3]
Devil may cry, devil may care
Distiller's got a scream
And now I know just why
When she's moving air
Can you feel the voltage
This is my time

California skies got room to spare
This is my time

[Chorus]
All in all and I'm
Loving every rise and fall
The sun will make and I will take
Breath to be sure of this
In the end and then
All will be forgiven when
Surrender rises high and I
Gave what I came to give
Say it now because you never know

Aw, never know

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 4]
Take it outside
Take it out there
Seems to me like
All the world gets high
When you take a dare
In the final moment
This is my time

[Chorus]
All in all and I'm
Loving every rise and fall
The sun will make and I will take
Breath to be sure of this
In the end and then
All will be forgiven when
Surrender rises high and I
Gave what I came to give
Say it now because you never know

Aw, never know



On Mercury - By The Way - 2002

[Verse 1]
I've got myself in a masochistic hold
Why don't you let go?
Shake it off just to redirect my flow
Come on let's go
Sit up straight, I'm on a double date
I've got to find my way into the light, heavy, middleweight
We don't stop rock around the clock
Motor-mouthing off in front of every other road block

[Pre-Chorus]
Come again and tell me
What you're going through
Like a girl who only knew
Her child was due

[Chorus]
Memories of everything
Of lemon trees on Mercury
Come to me with remedies
From five or six of seven seas
You always took me with a smile when I was down
Memories of everything
That blew through

[Verse 2]
Looking up into a reverse vertigo
What an undertow
Give it up, another stubborn Scorpio
Come on, let's go
Sit up straight, I'm on a double date
I've got to find my way into the light, heavy, middleweight
We don't stop, rock around the clock
Motor-mouthing off in front of every other road block

[Pre-Chorus]

[Verse 3]
To the moon she gave
Another good review
Turn around and look at me
It's really, really you

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Sit up straight, I'm on a double date
I've got to find my way into the light, heavy, middle weight
We don't stop, rock around the clock
Motor-mouthing off in front of every other road block

[Chorus][x2]

[Verse 1]
I change the key from C to D

Cat fight intimidation

Oh, oh, oh, oh

To read a mind you've got to re-
Define the line to make your circle sing, y'all

You see to me it's just a minor thing, y'all
He knows everything
To readjust you've got to trust
That all the fuss is just a minor thing, y'all

And I'm a minor king
It's just a minor thing
And I'm a minor king

[Verse 1]
Shiver for me girl
Deliver for me my darling
Pushing up to you
A river that runs right through you
Swim for your smile in a Blue Rock Quarry
Make it for me baby, you won't be sorry

Messy bed a part of cheating I won't fall for you

Shot from the pages of love and glory
Sleeping next to you and I'm in your dreams

Venice Queen - By The Way - 2002

[Verse 1]
Does it go from east to west, y'all
Body free and a body less, y'all
Come again just to start afresh and
Once again to find a home
In the moment of the meantime
Dropping in coming through the mesh, y'all
Checking in just to get it blessed, y'all
Hard to leave when it's picturesque and
Find a form that's free to roam

[Chorus 1]
Where you come from
Where you're going
Where you come from
Where you're going

[Verse 2]
Do it all then it all again, y'all
Make it up and you make a friend, y'all
Paddle on just around the bend and
Find a place where you can see
All the mamas and the papas
Take a chance on a recommend, y'all
Hard as hell just to comprehend, y'all
Disbelief that I do suspend and
Easy now to find a breeze

[Chorus 1]
Where you come from
Where you're going
Where you come from
Where you're going

[Verse 3]
We all want to tell her
Tell her that we love her
Venice gets a queen
Best I've ever seen
We all want to kiss her
Tell her that we miss her
Venice gets a queen
Best I've ever

I know you said you don't believe in God
We used to disagree
Now that it's time for you to leave

[Chorus 2]
G-L-O-R-I-A
Is love, my friend
My friend, my friend

[Verse 4]
Your stylish mess of silver hair
A woman of your kind is rare
Your uniform returns to air

[Chorus 2]
G-L-O-R-I-A
Is love, my friend
My friend, my friend

[Verse 5]
And now it's time for you to go
You taught me most of all I know
Where would I be without you, Glo?

[Chorus 2]
G-L-O-R-I-A
Is love, my friend
My friend, my friend

[Verse 6]
I see you standing by the sea
The waves you made will always be
Your kiss goodbye before you leave

[Chorus 2]
G-L-O-R-I-A
Is love, my friend
My friend, my friend



Bicycle Song - By The Way - 2002

[Verse 1]
Here she comes in a suit and tie
Shepard's bush and a leopard's pie
She marching to the funky beat of
James Brown and his dancing feet
Going to set your fish on fire
Pistol whipping of desire
So please do not resist your fate
I'll pick you up, yes it's a date

[Pre-Chorus]
How could I forget to mention the bicycle is a good invention?
Sitting there in a silent movie
Beside the only girl who really ever knew me
Happy days, but sad I'm facing
Heaven knows that I'm on the case
How could I forget to mention the bicycle?

[Chorus]
Somebody told the world
The beauty of your verse
My girl, I heard it first
The beauty of your verse

[Verse 2]
A sticky finger and a wicked taste
Got a lot of love and a lyrical case
Be sure to write it in your book
I promise not to look
Want to smell your sunny face
Funny place but it's never a waste
I'd hop this fence to make amends
I hope this movie never ends

[Pre-Chorus]
How could I forget to mention the bicycle is a good invention?
Make it up, making you my business
A funny buttercup but I lend her forgiveness
Happy days, but sad I'm facing
Heaven knows that I'm on the case
How could I forget to mention the bicycle?

[Chorus]
Somebody told the world
The beauty of your verse
My girl, I heard it first
The beauty of your verse
Somebody told the world
The beauty of your verse
My girl, I heard it first
The beauty of your verse



Runaway - By The Way - 2002

[Verse 1]
Walking around
Out of a town
Walking it out
When you want to
Soldiering my style is smiling
Turn it into whatever I've chosen
Take me now to the water

[Chorus]
Don't be late, I hear it
Going to be so very great and
Out the door I'm walking like a runaway
All the reasons that I count of you can hold away
More and more, I'm a walking like a runaway

[Verse 2]
Kick it around
Stare at the ground
Breaking it down
When you want to
Soldiering my days I've chosen
Dancing round, do whatever I want to
Take me now it's the water

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I think I know, everything you're going to say
I think you know, don't want to runaway

[Chorus]

[Outro]
All the reasons that I count of you can hold away
More and more, I'm a walking like a runaway [x3]



Dani California - Stadium Arcadium - 2006

[Verse 1]
Gettin' born in the state of Mississippi
Poppa was a copper and her momma was a hippie
In Alabama she would swing a hammer
Price you gotta pay when you break the panorama
She never knew that there was anythin' more than poor
What in the world, what does your company take me for?
Black bandana, sweet Louisiana
Robbin' on a bank in the state of Indiana
She's a runner, rebel and a stunner
On her merry way sayin', "Baby, what you gonna—?"
Lookin' down the barrel of a hot metal .45
Just another way to survive

[Chorus]
California, rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California, show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
She's a lover, baby and a fighter
Shoulda seen her comin' when it got a little brighter
With a name like Dani California
Day was gonna come when I was gonna mourn ya
A little loaded she was stealin' another breath
I love my baby to death

[Chorus]
California, rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California, show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
Who knew the other side of you?
Who knew what others died to prove?
Too true to say goodbye to you
Too true, too sad, sad, sad

[Verse 3]
Push the fader, gifted animator
One for the now and eleven for the later
Never made it up to Minnesota
North Dakota man was a gunnin' for the quota
Down in the Badlands she was savin' the best for last
It only hurts when I laugh
Gone too fast

[Chorus]
California, rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California, show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest, yeah, yeah
California, rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California, show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
Come to decide that the things that I tried
Were in my life just to get high on
When I sit alone, come get a little known
But I need more than myself this time
Step from the road to the sea to the sky
And I do believe that we rely on
When I lay it on, come get to play it on
All my life to sacrifice

To the well once more time to decide on
When it's killing me, when will I really see
All that I need to look inside?
Come to believe that I better not leave
Before I get my chance to ride
When it's killing me, what do I really need
All that I need to look inside

The more I like to let it go
Hey oh, whoa-whoa

Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Privately divided by a world so undecided
And there's nowhere to go
In between the cover of another perfect wonder
And it's so white as snow
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go
Ho!

[Verse 3: Anthony Kiedis]
When to descend to amend for a friend
All the channels that have broken down
Now you bring it up, I'm gonna ring it up
Just to hear you sing it out
Step from the road to the sea to the sky
And I do believe what we rely on
When I lay it on, come get to play it on
All my life to sacrifice

[Refrain: Anthony Kiedis]
Hey, oh
Listen what I say, oh
I got your hey, oh

In between the cover of another perfect wonder
And it's so white as snow
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go

[Interlude: Anthony Kiedis]
I said hey, hey yeah
Oh yeah, tell my love now
Hey, hey yeah
Oh yeah, tell my love now

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Privately divided by a world so undecided

Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go

This love... I'm in
We don't arrive, without a surprise
You're right... I'm wrong
Be free... Be long
Intimate sight has come into light



Stadium Arcadium - Stadium Arcadium - 2006

[Verse 1]
Bells around St. Petersburg when I saw you
I hope I get what you deserve
And this is where I find
Smoke surrounds your perfect face and I'm falling
Pushing a broom out into space
And this where I find the way

[Chorus]
The Stadium Arcadium, a mirror to the moon
Well I'm forming and I'm warming
State of the art until the clouds come crashing
Stranger things have happened both before and after noon
Well I'm forming and I'm warming
Pushing myself and no I don't mind asking now

[Verse 2]
Alone inside my forest room and it's storming
I never thought I'd be in bloom
But this is where I start
(Derelict days and the stereo plays
For the all night crowd that it cannot phase)
And I'm calling
(Tedious weeds that the media breeds
But the animal gets what the animal needs)
And I'm sorry

[Chorus]
The Stadium Arcadium, a mirror to the moon
Well I'm forming and I'm warming
State of the art until the clouds come crashing
Stranger things have happened both before and after noon
Well I'm forming and I'm warming
Pushing myself and no I don't mind asking now

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
And this is where I find
Rays of dust that wrap around your citizen
Kind enough to disavow
And this is where I stand

[Chorus]
The Stadium Arcadium, a mirror to the moon
Well I'm forming and I'm warming
State of the art until the clouds come crashing
Stranger things have happened both before and after noon
Well I'm forming and I'm warming
Pushing myself and no I don't mind asking
The Stadium Arcadium, a mirror to the moon
Well I'm forming and I'm warming
State of the art until the clouds come crashing

[Outro]
Stranger things have happened both before and after noon
Well I'm forming and I'm warming...to you



Hump De Bump - Stadium Arcadium - 2006

[Verse 1]
Forty detectives this week
Forty detectives strong
Takin' a stroll down Love Street
Strollin', is that so wrong?
Can I get my co-defendant?

[Chorus 1]
Hump de bump doop bodu
Bump de hump doop bop
Hump de bump doop bodu
(Oh no!)

Bump de hump doop bodu
Hump de bump doop bop
Bump de hump doop bodu

Bump, bump

[Chorus 2]
It must have been a hundred miles
Or any of a hundred styles
It's not about the smile you wear
But the way we make out

When I was another loner
Nothin' but a two beach comber
Anybody seen the sky?
I'm, I'm wide awake now

[Verse 2]
Workin' the beat as we speak
Workin' the belle du monde
Believe in the havoc we wreak
Believin', is that so wrong
Can I get my co-dependent?

[Chorus 1]
Hump de bump doop bodu
Bump de hump doop bop
Hump de bump doop bodu

Bump de hump doop bodu
Hump de bump doop bop
Bump de hump doop bodu

Bump bump

(C'mon!)

[Chorus 2]
It must have been a hundred miles
Or any of a hundred styles
It's not about the smile you wear
But the way we make out

When I was another loner
Nothin' but a two beach comber
Anybody seen the sky?
I'm, I'm wide awake now

[Chorus 1]
Hump de bump doop bodu
Bump de hump doop bop
Hump de bump doop bodu
(Oh no!)

Bump de hump doop bodu
Hump de bump doop bop
Bump de hump doop bodu

Bump bump

[Bridge]
Listen to me what I said
Try to get it through your head
A little bit of circumstance and
A chance to make out

Livin' in a citadel
It's hard enough to be yourself
Waiting for the bell to toll
And I am wide awake now

[Chorus 2]
It must have been a hundred miles
Or any of a hundred styles
It's not about the smile you wear
But the way we make out

When I was another loner
Nothin' but a two beach comber
Anybody seen the sky?
I'm, I'm wide awake now



She's Only 18 - Stadium Arcadium - 2006

[Verse 1]
She's only 18
Don't like the Rolling Stones
She took the short cut
To being fully grown
She's got that mood ring
A little sister rose
The smell of Springsteen
A pair of pantyhose
This talking picture show
Is leaking from a silhouette
She said "My man, you know
It's time to get your fingers wet"
Your hustle's busted
When you can't afford a cigarette
The last I heard from you
You were screaming "Handle it!"

[Hook]
Knock the world
Right off it's feet and straight onto it's head
The book of love will long be laughing after you are dead
Fascinated by the look of you
And what was said
Make a play
For all the brightest minds in like will share

[Verse 2]
I heard some P-Funk
Out on the road again
To get your head shrunk
Is what I recommend
It's in your bloodline
A perfect Frankenstein
Out on that lone pine
I'm going to make you mine
It's understood
You wrapped your voodoo right around my neck
You've got some glitter
On your kitty at the discotheque
I put my loving in your oven now it's time to check
The last I heard from you
You were screaming "Resurrect!"

[Hook]
Knock the world
Right off it's feet and straight onto it's head
The book of love will long be laughing after you are dead
Fascinated by the look of you
And what was said
Make a play
For all the brightest minds in like will share
Knock the world
Right off it's feet and straight onto it's head
The book of love will long be laughing after you are dead
Fascinated by the look of you
And what was said
Make a play
For all the brightest minds in like will share



Slow Cheetah - Stadium Arcadium - 2006

[Verse 1]
Waking up dead, inside of my head
Would never, never do, there is no med
No medicine to take

I've had a chance to be insane
Asylum from the falling rain
I've had a chance to break

[Verse 2]
It’s so bad, it’s got to be good
Mysterious girl misunderstood
Dressed like a wedding cake

Any other day and I might play
A funeral march for Bonnie Brae
Why try and run away?

[Chorus]
Slow cheetah come before my forest
Looks like it's on today
Slow cheetah come, it's so euphoric
No matter what they say

[Verse 3]
I know a girl, she worked in a store
She knew not what her life was for
She barely knew her name

They tried to tell her, she would never be
As happy as a girl in a magazine
She bought it with her pay

[Chorus]
Slow cheetah come before my forest
Looks like it's on today
Slow cheetah come, it's so euphoric
No matter what they say

[Verse 4]
Everyone has so much to say
They talk, talk, talk their lives away
Don’t even hesitate

Walking on down to the burial ground
It’s a very old dance with a merry old sound
Looks like it's on today

[Chorus]
Slow cheetah come before my forest
Looks like it's on today
Slow cheetah come, it's so euphoric
No matter what they say
Slow cheetah come before my forest
Looks like it's on today
Slow cheetah come, it's so euphoric
No matter what they say



Torture Me - Stadium Arcadium - 2006

[Verse 1]
Because I'm happy to be sad
I want it all, I want it bad
Oh, oh, it's what I know
A vintage year for pop I hear
The middle of the end is near
Let's go oh
It's what I know

[Chorus]
Torture me and torture me
Forcing me and so torture me, please
Torture me with sorcery
Forcing me, so torture me, please

All the leaves are turning brown
The wind is pushing me around
Let's go oh
It's what I know

[Chorus]
Torture me and torture me
Forcing me and so torture me, please
Torture me with sorcery
Forcing me, so torture me, please

[Verse 2]
The will of God is standing still
Brazilian children get their fill, let's go
Let's turn it up and dumb it down
The vision of your ultra sound is so
But all the leaves are turning brown
The wind is pushing me around, let's go
A vintage year for pop I hear
The middle of the end is near, it's so, ooh

[Chorus]
Torture me and torture me
It's forcing me and so torture me, please
Torture me with sorcery
Forcing me, so torture me, please
Torture me and torture me
It's forcing me and so torture me, please
Torture me with sorcery
Forcing me, so torture me, please

Especially In Michigan - Stadium Arcadium - 2006

Life is my friend, rake it up to take it in
Wrap me in your cinnamon
Especially in Michigan
Well I could be your friend

White clouds I'm in a mitten full of fisherman
C'mon Huckleberry Finn
Show me how to make her grin
Well I'm in Michigan

Cry me a future
Where the revelations run amok
Ladies and gentlemen
Lions and Tigers come running
Just to steal your luck, yeah

A rainy Lithuanian
Who's dancing as an Indian
Painted in my tiger skin
Especially in Michigan

Double chins and bowling pins
Unholy Presbyterians
Land is full of medicine
I find it when I'm slipping in

The tainted new librarian
(Who fainted when she tucked you in)
Well, I'm in Michigan
(Let's float away like Zeppelins)
On stoic gusts of Northern winds

Cry me a future
Where the revelations run amok
Ladies and gentlemen
Lions and Tigers come running
Just to steal your luck

Out on the farm we'll be
Swimming with the mother duck
Deep in the mitten where
Lions and tigers come running
Just to steal your luck

Life is my friend underwater violins
Order now from Ho Chi Min
A porcelain that comes in twins
When I’m in Michigan

Throw me in the loony bin
(Cause I can take it on the chin)
When I’m in Michigan
(The cleavage of your pillow skin)
Is moving like a violin

Cry me a future
Where the revelations run amok
Ladies and gentlemen
Lions and Tigers come running
Just to steal your luck

Out on the farm we'll be
Swimming with the mother duck
Deep in the mitten where
Lions and tigers come running
Just to steal your luck, oh yeah

And a subterranean marching band
Making noise for the boys in the Vatican

We're coming right on top of the tupelo
When she looks just like Brigitte Bardot

With a little bit of loving is all I can

C'mon Girl - Stadium Arcadium - 2006

[Verse 1]
Everything inside of me
Is burning up for you to see
And if we should get into it
A two way kind of syndicate, hold me
Compare us to a Ferris wheel
Just be sure what you want to steal
Some people do it by the book
But I prefer to go by feel, tell me

But every time I reappear
Now I have the words my dear
To whisper right into your ear, hey, yeah

The spirit of a dragon's tear
Is lovely at this time of year
The cave within your mountainside
Is deeper than than it will be wide, hold me
My disenchanted diplomat
Asleep inside the laundromat
Conveyer belts are moving and
I want you to be sure of that, tell me
And if you let it germinate
I know it will be worth the wait
Disputed by the news that it was you
Who tried to instigate, hey

C'mon girl, let's get it right
Let's get it right, let's get it right

Outwitted but she never quits
The trouble with a band of slits
Is washing off the muddy bits, hey yeah

Wet Sand - Stadium Arcadium - 2006

[Verse 1]
My shadow side, so amplified
Keeps coming back dissatisfied
Elementary sun but it's so
My love affair with everywhere
Was innocent, why do you care?
Someone start the car, time to go

You're the best I know

[Verse 2]
My sunny side has up and died
I'm betting that when we collide
The universe will shift into a low
The travesties that we have seen
Are treating me like Benzedrine
Automatic laughter from a pro

[Refrain 1]
My, what a good day for a walk outside
I'd like to get to know you a little better, baby
God knows that I really tried
My, what a good day for a take out bride
I'd like to say we did it for the better of

[Verse 3]
I saw you there so unaware
Those hummingbirds all in your hair
Elementary sun but it's so
The disrepair of Norma Jean
Could not compare to your routine
Balarama beauty goin' toe to toe

[Refrain 2]
My, what a good day for a, let it slide
I'd like to say we did it for the better of

[Chorus]
I thought about it and I brought it out
I'm motivated by the lack of doubt
I'm consecrated but I'm not devout
The mother, the father, the daughter, yeah

[Verse 4]
Right on the verge, just one more dose
I'm traveling from coast to coast
My theory isn't perfect, but it's close
I'm almost there, why should I care?
My heart is hurting when I share
Someone open up, let it show

[Refrain 3]
My, what a good day for a walk outside
I'd like to think we did it for the better of

[Chorus]
I thought about it and I brought it out
I'm motivated by the lack of doubt
I'm consecrated, but I'm not devout
The mother, the father, the daughter

[Bridge]
Oh, you don't form in the wet sand
You don't form at all
Woah, you don't form in the wet sand
I do, yeah
You don't form in the wet sand
You don't form at all
Woah, you don't form in the wet sand
I do, yeah

[Instrumental]



Hey - Stadium Arcadium - 2006

Won't somebody come along
And teach me how to keep it alive?
To survive

Come along and show me something
That I never knew in your eyes
Take away the tourniquet

I used to be so full of my confidence
I used to know just what I wanted
And just where to go
More than ever I could use a coincidence
But now I walk alone and talk about it when I know

Hey, oh yeah, how long?
I guess I ought to walk away
Hey, oh yeah, so long
What you gonna do today?

I don't wanna have to, but I will
If that's what I'm supposed to do
We don't wanna set up for the kill
But that's what I'm about to do

Let it on, I'll cut you off
When you're screaming into the phone
Hard to own
Anyway, I wanna let you know
That everything is on hold
What you gonna do to me?

You used to be so warm and affectionate
All the little things I used to hear my fairy say
But now you're quick to get into your regret
I'll take the fall and now you got to give it all away

Hey, oh yeah, how long?
I guess I ought to walk away
Hey, oh yeah, so long
What you gonna do today?

I don't wanna have to, but I will
If that's what I'm supposed to do
We don't wanna set up for the kill
But that's what I'm about to do
I don't wanna have to, but I will
If that's what I'm supposed to do
We don't wanna set up for the kill
But that's what I'm about to do

Hey, what would you say if I stayed?
Stayed for a while, if I may
Say it again and I'll come around
But not for the last time
Hey, what would you say if I changed?
I'll change everything but my name
Play it again and I'll come around, come around
But not for the last time, not for the last time

You used to be so warm and affectionate
I used to know just what I wanted
And just where to go
And now you're quick to get into your regret
And now I walk alone and talk about it when I know

Hey, oh yeah, how long?
I guess you gotta walk away
Hey, oh yeah, so long
What you gonna do today?

Hey, oh yeah, how long?
I guess you gotta get away
Hey, oh yeah, so long
What you gonna do today?



Desecration Smile - Stadium Arcadium - 2006

[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis — John Frusciante]
All alone not by myself
Another girl bad for my health
I've seen it all through someone else
And I
Another girl bad for my health

I celebrated but undisturbed
And serenaded by the terror bird
It's seldom seen and it's never heard, oh
Serenaded by the terror bird

[Chorus]
Never in the wrong time or wrong place
Desecration is the smile on my face
The love I made is the shape of my space
My face, my face

[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis — John Frusciante]
Disintegrated by the rising sun
A rolling blackout of oblivion
And I like to think that I'm your number one, now
A rolling blackout of oblivion

I wanna leave but I just get stuck
A broken record runnin' low on luck
There's heavy metal coming from your truck
And I'm
I'm a broken record runnin' low on luck

[Chorus]
Never in the wrong time or wrong place
Desecration is the smile on my face
The love I made is the shape of my space
My face, my face

[Bridge]
We could all go down to Malibu and make some noise
Coca Cola doesn't do the justice she enjoys
We could all come up with something new to be destroyed
We could all go down

[Verse 3: Anthony Kiedis — John Frusciante]
I love the feeling when it falls apart
I'm slow to finish but I'm quick to start and
Beneath the heather lies the meadowlark
And I'm
Slow to finish but quick to start

[Chorus]
Never in the wrong time or wrong place
Desecration is the smile on my face
The love I made is the shape of my space
My face, my face

Never in the wrong time or wrong place
Desecration is the smile on my face
The love I made is the shape of my space
My face, my face
Yeah



Tell Me Baby - Stadium Arcadium - 2006

[Verse 1]
They come from every state to find
Some dreams were meant to be declined
Tell the man what did you have in mind
What have you come to do?
No turning water into wine
No learning while you're in the line
I'll take you to the broken sign
You see these lights are blue
Come and get it
Lost it at the city limit
Say goodbye, cause they
Will find a way to trip it
Everybody's looking for a silly gimmick
Got to get away
Can't take it for another minute
This town is made of many things
Just look at what the current brings
So high it's almost promising
This place was made on you

[Chorus]
Tell me baby
What's your story?
Where you come from
And where you want to go this time, oh
Tell me lover
Are you lonely?
The thing we need is never all that hard to find, oh
Tell me baby
What's your story
Where you come from
And where you want to go this time, oh
You're so lovely
Are you lonely?
Giving up on the innocence you left behind

[Verse 2]
Some claim to have the fortitude
Too shrewd to blow the interlude
Sustaining pain to set the mood
Step out to be renewed
I'll move you like a baritone
Jungle brother's on the microphone
Getting over with the undertone
It's time to turn to stone
Chitty chitty baby
When your nose is in the nitty gritty
Life can be a little sweet
But life can be a little shitty
What a pity
Boston and a Kansas City
Looking for a hundred
But you only ever found a fifty
Three fingers in the honeycomb
You ring just like a xylophone
Devoted to the chromosome
The day that you left home

[Chorus]
Tell me baby
What's your story?
Where you come from
And where you want to go this time, oh
Tell me lover
Are you lonely?
The thing we need is never all that hard to find, oh
Tell me baby
What's your story
Where you come from
And where you want to go this time, oh
You're so lovely
Are you lonely?
Giving up on the innocence you left behind
Tell me baby
What's your story?
Where you come from
And where you want to go this time, oh
Tell me lover
Are you lonely?
The thing we need is never all that hard to find, oh
Tell me baby
What's your story
Where you come from
And where you want to go this time, oh
You're so lovely
Are you lonely?
Giving up on the innocence you left behind



Hard to Concentrate - Stadium Arcadium - 2006

[Verse 1]
Hustle, bustle and so much muscle
Cells about to separate, oh
And I find it hard to concentrate
And temporary, this cash and carry
I'm stepping up to indicate
The time has come to deviate and

[Chorus]
All I want is for you to be happy
And take this moment to make you my family
And finally you have found something perfect
And finally you have found

[Verse 2]
Death defying, this mess I'm buying
Its raining down with love and hate
And I find it hard to motivate
And estuary is blessed but scary, oh
Hearts about to palpitate
And I'm not about to hesitate
And want to treasure the rest of your days here
And give you pleasure in so many ways, dear
And finally you have found something perfect
And finally you have found
Here we go
Do you want me to show up for duty
And serve this woman and honor her beauty?
And finally you have found something perfect
And finally you have found yourself with me
Will you agree to take this man into your world
And now we are as one
My lone ranger the heat exchanger
Is living in this figure 8
And I'll do my best to recreate
Sweet precision and soft collision, oh
Hearts about to palpitate
And I find it hard to separate

[Chorus]
All I want is for you to be happy
And take this moment to make you my family
And finally you have found someone perfect
And finally you have found
All I want is for you to be happy
And take this moment to make you my family
And finally you have found someone perfect
And finally you have found



21st Century - Stadium Arcadium - 2006

[Verse 1]
All the creatures on the beaches
Making waves in a motion picture
Won't you keep this in between us?
Search and seizure wake up Venus
The dollar bill will mentally ill bill
Mom and dad take your 'Don't be sad pill'
Turn the screw and twist my language
Don't forsake me I'm contagious

[Chorus 1]
There's a reason for the 21st century
Not too sure but I know that it's meant to be
And that it's meant to be
Come on, ooh

[Bridge]
It's my favorite combination
Coming down with the favored nations
Deep rotation, mutilation
Learn to give and take dictation

[Chorus 2]
Oh, oh oh, oh oh
Like the Cain and Abel
Oh, oh oh, oh oh
Time to run this table

[Chorus 1]
There's a reason for the 21st century
Not too sure but I know that it's meant to be
And that it's meant to be

[Bridge]
Read me your scripture and
Read me your scripture
Read me your scripture and I will twist it
Show me your wrist and I
Show me your wrist and
Show me your wrist and I'll kiss it kiss it

[Chorus 2]
Oh, oh oh, oh oh
Like the Cain and Abel
Oh, oh oh, oh oh
It's time to run this table

[Verse 2]
Simple soldier hand it over
Stop and read what you just wrote her
Strangulation, altercation
Oral sex and bird migration

[Chorus 1][x2]
There's a reason for the 21st century
Not too sure but I know that it's meant to be
And that it's meant to be



She Looks to Me - Stadium Arcadium - 2006

[Verse 1]
Looks to me like heaven sent
No lullaby kid, no five percent
Anyway you want to cut that cake
She's dying from the likes of abandonment

[Bridge]
Lost in the valley without my horses
She needs somebody to hold

[Chorus]
It looked to me like heaven
Sent this for your roughest night
She looks to me, she looks to me, all right

Who's going to take you home
And hold you when things aren't so bright
She looks to me, she looks to me, all right

[Verse 2]
It's a long walk down those tracks
It's a dirty walk in, it's a dirty walk back
Going to learn a way too much
Shooting dope in the back of a Cadillac Jack

[Bridge]
Slow down the road to my back 40
She needs somebody to hold

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Down in the South seas
Give me your mouth please
Resuscitation
Is the way I found these
I give you major
You give me minor
Don't fade away
Like an ocean liner, now
Lost in the valley without my horses
No one can tell me what my remorse is
God made this lady that stands before me
She needs somebody to hold
She shows the world up with a smile
And then she throws the fight
She looks to me, she looks to me, all right
Down on the bathroom floor
She's searching for another light
She looks to me, she looks to me, all right

[Chorus]

[Chorus 1]
Readymade, readymade
Steady as the rhythm rolls
Readymade, readymade

Deep down in Arizona
We're going to rocket to Ramone's
In the city of Pomona, go

We're going to fop it all night
In the middle of the back porch, yeah

[Chorus 3]
Readymade, readymade
Baby oughta celebrate
Readymade, readymade
And now it's time to deviate

[Chorus 4]
Readymade, readymade
Rockin' for the sake of Slade
Readymade, readymade
Listen but don't be afraid

I've got a brother making trouble
In the state of California
I wish I knew another way
But I'm gonna have to clone you, hey

[Chorus 4]
Readymade, readymade
Rockin' for the sake of Slade
Readymade, readymade
Listen but don't be afraid

You got it
And if I stay the course I'll stay the night
Come get it



If - Stadium Arcadium - 2006

[Verse 1]
And if I had a clue
I'd know exactly what to do
If I were the wiser of the two
And if I saw it all so clear
I'd write it down and bend your ear
If I were the clearer of the two
We could take a walk into the
Canyons of the Fifth Avenue
Sing and dance just to name a few

[Chorus]
All I do
All I do

[Verse 2]
And if I heard the Angels sing I'd
Sing it back to you and bring
Sound of heaven ringing just for you
And if I saw the sun fall down
I'd pick it up and make a crown
One that was a perfect fit for you
We could take a walk
Into the apple orchard by the school
We could make a little residue
We could find a place to stay
A secret little hide away
Spend a little time inside of you

[Chorus]
All I do
All I do

[Bridge]
All eyes
All eyes
All eyes on you

[Chorus]
All I do

Make You Feel Better - Stadium Arcadium - 2006

[Verse 1]
She's the one she's the only one
She's got ripped back light
Gonna make me come
I say when I smile I'm a really smile
I got dreams so wide like a country mile

[Chorus 1]
I said now, I'll take it
It's better for you
Somehow we'll make it
Because that's what we do

[Verse 2]
Pick a star in the open sky
I see you see me and that is why I
Hop along to the cowboy beat
When I feel your fire jump up to meet

[Chorus 1]
I said now, I'll take it
It's better for you
Somehow we'll make it
Because that's what we do

[Chorus 2]
Something out there where love is your only friend
And we are the ones that will make you feel better
And someone to spare when love is the only end
And we are the ones that will make you feel better, oh yeah

[Verse 3]
In a world that has run amok
I've got to set my sights just to get struck
I walk away from the rank and file
With a punched out mouth and a pack of style
I say she's the one she's the only one
Make me search myself until I'm done and
Tell me now in a telegram
Do the sea of stars make a diagram and

[Chorus 2]
Something out there where love is your only friend
And we are the ones that will make you feel better
And someone to spare when love is the only end
And we are the ones that will make you feel better, oh yeah

Oh yeah hey hey
Oh yeah

[Verse 4]
So alive I arrive on dust, you can search
My mind for the red on rust I said
Take me there and she really cares
Lights up for me going to hear my prayers, I said

[Chorus 1]
I said now, I'll take it
It's better for you
Somehow we'll make it
Because that's what we do

[Chorus 2]
Something out there where love is your only friend
And we are the ones that will make you feel better
And someone to spare when love is the only end
And we are the ones that will make you feel better, oh yeah

[Outro]
We are the ones that will make you feel better[x4]



Animal Bar - Stadium Arcadium - 2006

[Verse 1]
Never 21 when everyone's a sailor
Coming up strong at the animal bar
Ever loving mug of Mr. Norman Mailer
Turn another page at the animal bar
And it won't be long
No it won't be long
No it won't be long
Because it can't be long

[Pre-Chorus]
I I I the cry of isolation
I I I the high of meditation
I I I for sweet precipitation
I I I the high of deprivation
And it won't be long
No it won't be long
No it won't be long
Because it can't be long

[Chorus]
Rain on my frustration
Stake my claim now break this
Wash me down my station
Makes more rain forsaken
In between the sky and every piece of the earth
(1,2,3 let's break this)
Runnin' through the mud
I gotta feeling of worth
(1,2,3 forsake this)

[Verse 2]
All aboard the ship
Cause you're gonna need an ark
When the wet comes down
You'll be swimming like a shark
Mopping up the pain and
I'm a little older
Right as rain
At the animal bar
And it won't be long
No it won't be long
No it won't be long
Because it can't be long

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Raindrops will fall from the sky
Stealing their shape from your eye
Now we can all get some sleep
The water the water the water
Saving us from the heat

Some things will die in their place
Others will leave little trace
Fire will come find its day
The water the water the water
Washing it all away

[Chorus]



So Much I - Stadium Arcadium - 2006

A funny thing always happens when

Rip it out now shake your hips
Backing off the apocalypse

We're down here in division of mystery
Someone send for back up

[Verse 2]
Every other day you say your gonna have to bury 'em
(Whoop-de-whoop-de-get-ta-gala-goop-ta!)
Famous last words from the fuckin' Laysarium
(Whoop-de-whoop-de-get-ta-gala-goop-ta!)
Descendents had a record sayin' somethin' bout Milo

We Believe - Stadium Arcadium - 2006

[Verse 1]
The curtain is open a head to put dope in
Now we will come clean it the future we've seen it
No, no, I know, I said, no no
It's like a dream that falls away
Into the night where we can play
I'm on a train one happy day
Two eyes for sight three times I pray
Soda pop we've got to set up shop
And when the weather comes we've got a pressure drop
We don't know but every day I go
To see what I can bring into a cameo, oh oh, oh no

[Pre-Chorus]
We believe, we believe

[Chorus]
Climb a tree for monkey business
Write a check out to forgiveness
All the world on half an acre
Pushing dirt into a quaker

[Verse 2]
The mission, the method
The downfall arrested
Because it's not the first time
Nor is it the worst time, no no, oh no
To see the bird without a care
For in a word it's nice out there
In a tree my mama bear
Will be all right with proper care
Hey hey, hey
Boomerang into a bigger bang
A little cry of love because they cannot sing
Cherokee, what did the pharaoh see?
Another time and space another place to be

[Pre-Chorus][x2]

[Chorus][x2]

[Verse 3]
The motive, the measure
The purpose, the pleasure
The risk, is it worth it?
The disc, is it perfect?
I found you amongst them
The flower with young stem
Disparage, the broken
The marriage, eloping



Turn It Again - Stadium Arcadium - 2006

[Verse 1]
Some of us get a little
And some a lot
We've got to make due
With whatever we got
We get it hot we cool it down
And then we pass it around

[Verse 2]
You can dance
For the sake of a golden day
Take a chance on getting rid
Of whatever's in your way
Next stop big hop
Is turning night into day

[Verse 3]
Sometimes when
I'm lying there all alone
I think of every little nothing
That we could own
To overthrow all of you
Who have overgrown

[Chorus 1]
All my friends
Like to spend
Days on end
On the mend
I turn to you, I turn into
And then I turn it again

[Chorus 2]
Here we go
All we know
Heavy load
Start to float
Without a doubt, we turn it out
And then we turn it again

[Verse 5]
I've come to learn
Whatever time I can find to spend
Taking flight into
Whatever light we bend
Out on the street
I get a beat and then
I turn it to ten

[Verse 6]
Lace boots and the
Ladies of Kazakhstan
Kick them high to the sky
All of this just because we can
I turn to Cuba
Then Aruba then the Dominican

[Chorus 1]
All my friends
Like to spend
Days on end
On the mend
I turn to you, I turn into
And then I turn it again

[Chorus 2]
Here we go
All we know
Heavy load
Start to float
Without a doubt, we turn it out
And then we turn it again
(Let’s dance all night and day now
Get down and show the way how
I need to know that you are there)

[Bridge]
We've got to move it
If we want to do our best
We've got to shake it
If we want to keep it fresh

[Verse 7]
I'm turning down
All the heavy psychology
To cut a rug
And I make no apology
I turn a cheek, I turn a key
And then I turn it for free

[Verse 8]
We've got to move it
Just a little to hit the spot
A whirling dervish in a flurry
A fox to trot
Come clown around, a robot
Doing the astronaut

[Chorus 1]
All my friends
Like to spend
Days on end
On the mend
I turn to you, I turn into
And then I turn it again

[Chorus 2]
Here we go
All we know
Heavy load
Start to float
Without a doubt, we turn it out
And then we turn it again
(Two things I want to say now
You make it all ok now
I need to know that you are there)

[Instrumental]



Death of a Martian - Stadium Arcadium - 2006

[Verse 1: RHCP]
Bear paws and rascal power
Watching us in your garage
Big girl you ate the neighbor
The nova is over
Wake up and play
Balleradio
Make room for Clara's bare feet
The love of a Martian

Tick tock and waiting for the meteor
This clock is opening another door

[Hook: RHCP]
Lots of love just keep it comin'
Makin' something out of nothin'
These are the best that I
I don't know how to say
Losin' what I love today
These are the best that I
Lots of love just keep it comin'
Makin' something out of nothin'
These are the best that I
I don't know what to say
Look at what I've lost today
And these are the things that I

[Verse 2: RHCP]
Blood flowers in the kitchen
Signing off and winding down
This Martian ends her mission
The nova is over
She caught the ball
By the mission bell
Chase lizards, bark at donkeys
The love of a Martian

Let's bow our heads
And let the trumpets blow
Our girl is gone
God bless her little soul

[Hook: RHCP]

[Outro: RHCP]
She’s got sword in case
Though this is not her Lord, in case
The one who can’t afford to face
Her image is restored to grace
Disappeared. No trace. Musky tears. Suitcase
The down turn brave little burncub bearcareless turnip snare rampages pitch color pages
Down and out but not in Vegas
Disembarks and disengages. No loft
Sweet pink canary cages plummet pop dewskin fortitude for the sniffing black noses that snort and allude
To the dangling trinkets that mimic the dirt cough go drink its
It's for you
Blue battered naval town slip kisses delivered by duck muscles and bottlenosed grifters
Arrive in time to catch the late show
It's a beehive barrel race. A shehive stare and chase
Wasted feature who tried and failed to reach her
Embossed beneath a box in the closet that's lost
The kind that you find when you mind your own business
Shiv sister to the quickness before it blisters into the newmorning milk blanket. Your ilk is funny to the turnstyle touch bunny
Whose bouquet set a course for bloom without decay
Get your broom and sweep echoes of yesternights fallen freckles… away…



Monarchy of Roses - I'm With You - 2011

[Verse 1]
The crimson tide is flowing through your fingers as you sleep
The promise of a clean regime are promises we keep
Do you like it rough I ask, and are you up to task?
The calicos of Pettibon where cultures come to clash

[Chorus 1]
Several of my best friends wear
The colors of the crown
And Mary wants to build it up
And Sherry wants to tear it all back down, girl
The savior of your light
The monarchy of roses
The monarchy of roses tonight

[Verse 2]
The cross between my former queen
Her legendary stare
The holy tears of Ireland
A lovely cross to bear

[Chorus 2]
Several of my best friends know
The secrets of this town
Mary wants to raise it up
And Sherry wants to spin it all around, girl
The sailors of the night
The monarchy of roses
The monarchy of roses tonight

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus 1]
Several of my best friends wear
The colours of the crown
And Mary wants to fill it up
And Sherry wants to tear it all back down, girl
The saviour of your light
The monarchy of roses
The monarchy of roses

[Outro]
Hey, yeah
We all want the rose you know
I said hey, yeah
Show us love before you go
Say I will, then I say I want to
The story knows that I will never taunt you
Hey, yeah
We all want the rose you know
I said hey, yeah
Show us love before you go
Say I will, then I say I want to
The story knows that I will always haunt you



Factory Of Faith - I'm With You - 2011

[Verse 1]
All my life I was
Swinging for the fence
I was looking for the triple
Never playing good defense
We were gunnin' for the glitter
Every hot and heavy hitter
She was never really there
So I couldn't really get her

I said factually I, I'm just a piece of it
Factually I, the very least of it

[Verse 2]
Piece of work
I was really quite a jerk
Keeping score is such a bore,
A busy mind could go berserk
Oh, feast on this
I was fishing for a hook
So I took a little trip
And I opened up the book

[Pre-Chorus]
I said factually I, I'm just a piece of it
Factually I, the very least of it
Factually I, it's just a medicine
Make you wanna cry, why don't they let us in?

[Chorus]
Be my wife
I think you're right that we should mate
Tell your friends I've got a factory of faith
Late last night I had a dream that it was great
Tell your friends I've got a factory of faith
I've got a factory of

[Verse 3]
Crack your whip
She's confessing from the hip
She was good at getting there
But not as much for round-trip
Oh all this time
I was searching for a dream
I was slippin' in and out
Of every other sex machine

[Pre-Chorus]
I said factually I, I'm just a piece of it
Factually I, the very least of it
Factually I, it's just a medicine
Make you wanna cry, why don't they let us in?

[Chorus]
Be my wife
I think you're right that we should mate
Tell your friends I've got a factory of faith
Late last night I had a dream that it was great
Tell your friends I've got a factory of faith
I've got a factory of

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Be my wife
I think you're right that we should mate
Tell your friends I've got a factory of faith
Late last night I had a dream that it was great
Tell your friends I've got a factory of faith
I've got a factory of

Faith
And love
Lo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh



Brendan's Death Song - I'm With You - 2011

[Verse 1]
Live and die before I get it done, will you decide?
Take my words and turn them into signs that will survive
Because a long time ago, I knew not to deprive
It's safe out there and now you're everywhere, just like the sky
And you are love, you are the love supreme, you are the rise
And when you hear this, you’ll know it’s your jam, it’s your goodbye

[Chorus]
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the drummer drums
He's going to play my song
To carry me along
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the boatman comes to ferry me away
To where we all belong

[Verse 2]
We all crossed when we were feeling lost it's just the time
Kateri cried the day her lover died she recognized
Because he gave her a life of real love it's no surprise
The nights are long but the years are short when you're alive
Way back when will never be again, it was a time
It's going to catch you so glad I met you to walk the line

[Chorus]
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the drummer drums
He's going to play my song
To carry me along
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the boatman comes to ferry me away
To where we all belong

[Chorus]
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the drummer drums
He's going to play my song
To carry me along
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the boatman comes to ferry me away
To where we all belong

[Verse 3]
Let me live so when it's time to die even the reaper cries
Let me die so when it's time to leave another sun will rise
I said yeah!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
I said yeah!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

[Chorus]
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the drummer drums
He's going to play my song
To carry me along
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the boatman comes to ferry me away
To where we all belong

[Outro]
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone

[Chorus]
Tell my boy I love him so
Tell him so he knows
Lost in Ethiopia
Walk out in that road

[Verse 1]
Lucy Rebar
She's a friend of mine
Later she'll go
Back and redefine the line
It's getting longer all the time
Oh yeah

Drinking sunshine
She likes the taste of it
She had a goldmine
But then she wasted it away
You should have seen her yesterday
Oh yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Sing along the way
Nothing stops the ache

[Chorus 1]
Sugar daddy
Loves her madly
Cosma Sheiva
Got off, made you a believer
I don't need to
Tender, why do I believe you?
Annie wants a baby now
Annie wants a baby any way she can

Missing pieces
She's got a lot of them
Time decreases
I wish I thought of them before
Before it's time to close the store

Distillation
A lonely sycophant
Some liberation
The only seed we ever plant
I want to help you but I can't
No, no

Sing along the way
Nothing stops the ache

[Chorus 2]
Sugar daddy
Loves her madly
Love her, leave her

Neon soldiers
Left her now you've gotten older
Annie wants a baby now
Annie wants a baby any way she can

It's getting longer all the time
It's time to re-design the sign
Oh yeah
Sing along the way



Look Around - I'm With You - 2011

[Verse 1]
Stiff club, its my nature
Custom love is the nomenclature
Turn down mass confusion
Hit the road 'cause we just keep cruisin'
Double my fun, double my vision
Long hard look at my last decision
Hustle here, hustle there
Hustle me bitch and you best beware

[Refrain]
It's emotional and I told you so
But you had to know, so I told you

Soft walk to horizon
One big crash that no one dies in
This is for the folks in Fayetteville
It'll come true if you say it will

[Chorus]
Look around, look around, look around
All around, all around, all around
Look around, look around, look around
All around, all around, all around

It's emotional and I told you so
But you had to know so I told you

[Verse 3]
Please don't look right through me
Hurts my heart when you do that to me
Street life out my window
City made breeze gonna stroke my skindow
Just a lot of words on an old brick wall
Rob a lot of banks, got a pedigree scrawl
Put my peg into your square
Run around like we just don't care

[Chorus]
Look around, look around, look around
All around, all around, all around
Look around, look around, look around
All around, Oh yeah!

And I'm hitting a wall
Wanna feel it all around
When I'm feeling small
And I'm hitting a wall
Wanna feel it all around



The Adventures of Rain Dance Maggie - I'm With You - 2011

[Verse 1]
Lipstick junkie
Debunk the all in one
She came back wearing a smile
Looking like someone drugged me
That wanted to unplug me
No one in here is on trial
Its just a turn-around
And we go, oh
Well and we go, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Tic-toc, I want to
Rock you like the '80s
Cock-blocking isn’t allowed
Tugboat Shiela is into memorabilia
Who said three is a crowd?
We better get it on the go

[Chorus 1]
Hey, now
We’ve got to make it rain somehow
She told me to
And showed me what to do
Our Maggie makes it in a cloud

I said hey, now
We’ve got to make it rain somehow
She told me to
And show me what to do
She knows how to make it loud

[Verse 3]
Rain dance Maggie advances to the final
Who knew that she had the goods?
Little did I know
Her body was warm delicious vinyl
To your neck of the woods
I want to lick a little bit

[Chorus 1]
Hey, now
We’ve got to make it rain somehow
She told me to
And showed me what to do
Our Maggie makes it in a cloud

[Bridge]
You got the wrong girl
But not for long, girl
It's in the song, girl
'Cause I’ll be gone, girl

[Chorus 1]
Hey, now
We’ve got to make it rain somehow
She told me to
And showed me what to do
Our Maggie makes it in a cloud

[Chorus 3]
I said hey, now
I want to rock this rowdy crowd
She told me to
And told me what to do
She knows how to make it loud

But not for long, girl
It's in the song, girl
'Cause I’ll be gone, bye, bye, bye, yeah
Bye bye, bye, girl

Bye bye

Did I let you know?
Would you like to go?



Goodbye Hooray - I'm With You - 2011

[Verse 1]
Junior pimps at the old café
Got to chase those girls around
Westbound, drunk with lots to say
But he never makes a sound

Hustlers get what they deserve
But it's always half the gate
Good things come to those who wait
Like an expiration date

Save your breath for the black and white
Every dog will have his day

Happiness Loves Company - I'm With You - 2011

[Verse 1]
Start marching
'Cause you think you shot to number one
Counting days and
Skipping your stones into the sun
Over age and under thumb, oh
Does it weigh a ton?
I'll be yours tonight
Living the dream of a meteorite

[Chorus]
Start jumping 'cause
We've got something to say, yeah
Young lovers keep it pumping
In the streets of L.A., yeah

[Verse 2]
Short stroking doesn't fly
Better to go for broke
Watch you smoking Mary Jane
And does it make you choke?
Jumping the fence, riding the rails, oh
Can you take a joke?
I'll be yours today
Living the dream with a capital K

[Chorus]
Start jumping 'cause
We've got something to say, yeah
Young lovers keep it pumping
In the streets of L.A., yeah

[Bridge]
Tell me now, I'll tell you how
Just show me where to send

[Post-Chorus]
Make time for love and your happiness
The Mothers of Invention are the best
We all know and struggle with some loneliness
A tender mess for everyone, I guess
I guess

[Verse 3]
Half blinded
I'm reminded how to find the stairs
Nickel and dimin'
Think it's time to play some musical chairs
Dirty laundry, what a quandary
Ask her if she cares
I'll be yours and more
Better than ever, like never before

[Chorus]
Start jumping 'cause
We've got something to say, yeah
Young lovers keep it pumping
In the streets of L.A

[Post-Chorus]
Make time for love and your happiness
The Mothers of Invention are the best
We all know and struggle with some loneliness
A tender mess for everyone, I guess
I guess

[Verse 4]
Sweet talking
As I'm walking through your part of town
Never again
Will Johnny C. a Love Supreme be found
Is it ever meant to be?
And is it so profound?
Is it you and me?
A billion to one, make history
A history

[Outro]
Said yeah, oh yeah
Said yeah, oh yeah
I said yeah, oh yeah



Police Station - I'm With You - 2011

[Verse 1]
I saw you at the police station
And it breaks my heart to say
Your eyes had wandered off
To something distant, cold and grey
I guess you didn't see it coming
Someone's gotten used to slumming
Dreaming of the golden years
I see you had to change careers
Far away
But we both know its somewhere

[Verse 2]
I saw you on the back page
Of some free press yesterday
The driftwood in your eyes
Said nothing short of love for pay
I know you from another picture
Of someone with the most conviction
We used to read the funny papers
Fool around and pull some capers
Not today
Send a message to her
A message that I'm coming
Coming to pursue her

[Chorus 1]
Down home country
I rest my face on your bed
I've got you ten times over
I'll chase you down 'til you're dead

[Verse 3]
I saw you on a TV station
And it made me want to pray
An empty shell of loveliness
Is now dusted with decay
What happened to the funny paper?
Smiling was your money maker
Someone ought to situate her
Find a way to educate her
All the way
Time to come and find you
You can't hide from me girl
So never mind what I do

[Chorus 2]
Down home country
I rest my face on your bed
I met my soulmate country
And I left it all for your head

[Verse 4]
I saw you in the church yard
And there was no time to exchange
You were getting married
And it felt so very strange
I guess I didn't see it coming
Now I guess it's me who's bumming
Dreaming of the golden years
You and I were mixing tears
Not today
Not for me but someone
I never could get used to
So now I will refuse to

[Outro]
Down home country
I rest my face on your bed
I met my soulmate country
And I left it all for your head
I've got my best foot forward
And I'll chase you down 'til you're dead



Even You Brutus? - I'm With You - 2011

[Verse 1]
God is good and fate is great
When it feels so strong it's hard to wait
You never know how it might unfold
Hearts to break and bodies to hold
Time will tell, but it never gets old
Like I told you I'm in for a long, long

[Verse 2]
Had to have been one of those things
That took place in outer space
A match made in heaven
Not a scratch on her face
Angels must have smoked some dust
Singing songs, about "In God We Trust"
Some things slide, but this is a must
Like I told you there's a time for finding out

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Ah, people try to tell me what not to do
"You shouldn't make it with a younger girl"
And too many chances for the foot to drop
I tried to tell them that I found a pearl
Well, like I told you be careful what you're asking for

[Chorus]
Hey, sister Brutus
Got a mess of a better half, ow!
Hey, sister Judas
Even you never had my back

[Verse 3]
She was the cutest thing that I ever did see
A drink in her hand and I don't mean tea
She was with a dude, but I just didn't care
I had to find out, these moments are rare
And Stevie says, "All is fair."
Like I told you there is something for everyone

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Well I guess I never told you some things
That I really, really wanted to say
Did I do everything I could do
Or did the mice just need to play?
Like I told you there's more than meets the eye

[Chorus]
Hey, sister Brutus
Got a mess of a better half, ow!
Hey, sister Judas
Even you never had my back

[Pre-Chorus 3]
I'm not trying to point fingers at you
And I'm not trying to lay any blame
But when it comes to the punishment
Girl, you know how to bring the pain
Like I told you, I'd do it all again

[Chorus]
Hey, sister Brutus
Got a mess of a better half, ow!
Hey, sister Judas
Even you never had my back

[Outro]
Come on
Hey, sister Brutus
There's a fury to the woman's wrath
Hey, sister Judas
Even you never had my back



Meet Me At The Corner - I'm With You - 2011

[Verse 1]
Please don't ask me who
Who you think I am
I could live without that
I'm just a modest man

[Chorus]
Meet me at the corner and, oh
Tell me what to do
'Cause I'm messed up on you
And had I known all that I do now
I'm guessing we're through now
Receding into the forest
I will lay around in wait
And I'll wait for you

[Verse 2]
Please don't ask me where
Where you think I've been
I've been a lot of places
But this could be my win

[Chorus]
Meet me at the corner where I'll
Tell me what to do
'Cause I'm messed up on you
And had I known all that I do now
I'm guessing we're through now
Receding into the forest
I will lay around and wait
And I'll wait for you

[Bridge: Josh Klinghoffer]
I feel so bad, I thought you'd want to know
I feel so bad, I thought you'd want to know
Something I wanna show
I thought you ought to know

[Verse 3]
Please don't say you want
To keep in touch out there
To see you on the corner
That I just can't bear

[Chorus]
Meet me at the corner and, oh
Tell me what to do
'Cause I messed up on you
And had I known all that I do now
I'm guessing we're through now
Receding into the forest
I will lay around and wait

[Outro]
Hey, and I turn
I turn my head when I thought
I saw a sign from the gods
A sign from the gods
That you weren't meant to be mine
And it's fine
Taking it all for a ride
'Til the day when it's gone
Mystified by where it all went wrong
When it's gone
I live and I learn
And I lose and I win
But it's better than ever whenever I'm in
I thank you girl for everywhere that we’ve been

The Getaway - The Getaway - 2016

[Verse 1]
That’s right, you’re right
We will do our thing tonight alright
Take me through the future
It’s time, you’re fine
Just another color coded crime
Incision and a suture
You told my friend
We would get it on no matter when
A supercavitation
Let’s go, you show
Me something no one will ever know
A love hallucination

[Pre-Chorus]
Another lonely superstar
To getaway inside your car
Take it much too far
Surrender to the brave inside
A lover that another tried
Take it, too my ride

[Chorus 1]
You don’t have to keep it if it’s mine
(Another lonely superstar to getaway inside your car)
Another place maybe another time
(Surrender to the brave inside a lover that another tried)

[Verse 2]
Complete repeat
Sitting in your car and on your street
Lost in California
Let’s steal this wheel
Take a spin to find out how we feel
Just around the corner
Slow down for sound
Turn it up and no we can’t be found
The body that we transcend
Asleep, you weep
Find out that the trick is never cheap
A melancholy girlfriend

[Pre-Chorus]
Another lonely superstar
To getaway inside your car
Take it much too far
Surrender to the brave inside
A lover that another tried
Take it, too my ride

[Chorus 1]
You don’t have to keep it if it’s mine
(Another lonely superstar to getaway inside your car)
Another place maybe another time
(Surrender to the brave inside a lover that another tried)

[Bridge]
That’s right, you’re right
We will do our thing tonight, alright
Drive the constellation
It’s time, you’re fine
Just another color coded crime
The song is fascination

[Pre-Chorus]
Another lonely superstar
To getaway inside your car
Take it much too far
Surrender to the brave inside
The lover that another tried
Take it, too my ride

[Chorus 2]
A May-December might not be so smart
(Another lonely superstar to getaway inside your car)
Arrivals that we wish would not depart
(Surrender to the brave inside a lover that another tried)

[Outro]
Don’t be late cause you’re my savior
Make it great whatever stays
Golden gate my rearranger
Hold my name inside your rays



Dark Necessities - The Getaway - 2016

[Verse 1]
Coming on to the light of day we got
Many moons that are deep at play so I
Keep an eye on the shadow smile
To see what it has to say
You and I both know
Everything must go away
What do you say?

[Verse 2]
Spinning knot that is on my heart is like a
Bit of light and a touch of dark you got
Sneak attack from the zodiac
But I see your fire spark
Eat the breeze and go
Blow by blow and go away
What do you say?
Yeah

[Chorus]
You don't know my mind
You don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design and
Tell the world that I'm
Falling from the sky
Dark necessities are part of my design

[Verse 3]
Stumble down to the parking lot you got
No time for the afterthought they're like
Ice Cream for an Astronaut
Well that's me looking for we
Turn the corner and
Find the world at your command
Playing the hand
Yeah

[Chorus]
You don't know my mind
You don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design
Tell the world that I'm
Falling from the sky
Dark necessities are part of my design

[Interlude]
Do you want this love of mine?
Darkness helps us all to shine
Do you want it, do you want it now?
Do you want it all the time?
But darkness helps us all to shine
Do you want it, do you want it now?

[Verse 4]
Pick you up like a paperback with the
Track record of a maniac so I
Move it in and we unpack
It's the same as yesterday
Any way we roll
Everything must go away
What do you say?
Yeah

[Chorus]
You don't know my mind
You don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design
Tell the world that I'm
Falling from the sky and
Dark necessities are part of my design

[Outro]
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah



We Turn Red - The Getaway - 2016

[Intro]
We got large and we got small
We got a swimming pool and a cannon ball
We turn red and we turn green
It’s the craziest thing I’ve ever seen

[Verse 1]
Lost my mind ’cause I’m on the plastic
Who knew it’s so damn drastic
Show me what it is you believe in
Slowly she sinks all her teeth in
Do you want to go fishing in New Orleans?
Do you want to get up early in the morning?
Take me to the river where we do the little storming
Hallelujah, I feel it warming

[Pre-Chorus]
Sitting here I count the moons
The orders we obeyed
Every night ’fore we go to bed
I watch while the others pray

[Chorus]
Send it off through Delaware just
Make it fair for the legionnaires
Paint a simple portrait of my kind
Permission to the heartless bombs
Gold Plated Hate and the waitress moms
Serving up the stories of my mind

[Verse 2]
Mexico, you are my neighbor
Home of the let’s be braver
Give me all your sick and your tired
Races that we admire
Do you want to go dancing in Chicago?
Trinidad’s got it bad for Tobago
Take me to the lake where we do the Avocado
Hallelujah, a desparado

[Pre-Chorus]
Sitting here I count the moons
The orders we obeyed
Every night ’fore we go to bed
I watch while the others pray

[Chorus]
Send it off through Delaware just
Make it fair for the legionnaires
Paint a simple portrait of my kind
Permission to the heartless bombs
Gold Plated Hate and the waitress moms
Serving up the stories of my mind

[Bridge]
Coming down from the deserts where you
Caught a glimpse of the billionaire
Tell me I’m the right one for the ride
Paper signs out on the lawns
Gold minds and the priceless pawns
Does your canyon really open wide?

[Outro]
We got large and we got small
We got a swimming pool and a cannon ball
We turn red and we turn green
It’s the craziest thing I’ve ever seen



The Longest Wave - The Getaway - 2016

[Verse 1]
Throw me all around
Like a boomerang sky
Whatever you do
Don't tell me why
Poppies grow tall
Then say bye bye
The wave is here

[Verse 2]
A seamless little team
And then we tanked
I guess we're not so sacrosanct
The tip of my tongue
But then we blanked
The wave is here
Waiting on the wind
To tell my side

[Verse 3]
Ready set jet
But she never gets far
Listen to your skin
From the seat of my car
Two centipedes stuck
In one glass jar
The longest wave
Waiting on the wind
To tell my side

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatcha want?
Whatcha need?
Do you love?

[Chorus]
Maybe I'm the right one
Maybe I'm the wrong
Just another play, the pirate, and the papillon
Time to call it a day

Maybe you're my last love
Maybe you're my first
Just another way to play inside the universe
Now I know why we came

[Verse 4]
Sterile as the barrel
Of an old 12 gauge
Under my skin
And half my age
Hotter than the wax
On a saxifrage
The longest wave
Waiting on the wind
To turn my page

[Verse 5]
Steady your sails
For the butterfly flap
Whatever you do
Don't close that gap
I'm dreaming of a woman
But she's just my nap
Your ship is in
Waiting on the tide so I can swim

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatcha want
Whatcha need
Do you love

[Chorus]
Maybe I'm the right one
Maybe I'm the wrong
Just another play, the pirate, and the papillon
Time to call it a day

Maybe you're my last love
Maybe you're my first
Just another way to play inside the universe
Now I know why we came

[Outro]
Now I know why we came
Now I know



Goodbye Angels - The Getaway - 2016

Suicide a month before I met you
Deep regrets, I never could forget you
Somehow you made your way to my decade
Ayo ayo ayo ayo my girl

In the sun, I see you with your guard down
Number one, you're moving to a hard town
Do not dismiss the promise that you made me
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, my time

Overkill you took another red pill
On the sheet is everything that you spilled
We are the ones you want to know right now
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, black light

Come again to murder your report card
Just a friend to kiss you in the court yard
You are the one I want to be stuck with
Ayo ayo ayo ayo big fight

Favor some
Way too young
Slave to none
Way too young

Say goodbye my love
I can see it in your soul
Say goodbye my love
Thought that I could make you whole
Let your lover sail
Death was made to fail

Sticky fingers find the way to take her
Crumple up another piece of paper
I know your days are numbered when it comes to
Ayo ayo ayo ayo this life

Slip away into the solar system
Straighter rays, you find a way to twist them
Some like it dark and now I know where to
Ayo ayo ayo ayo find you

Serpentine, I think she was an Aussie
Bloody hell, a common kamikaze
Give up the ghost before you go under
Ayo ayo aye ayo wonder

Kicking hard and looking for a rescue
Watch me starve was never to impress you
I would have killed the part of me to have you
Ayo ayo ayo ayo story

Say goodbye my love
I can see it in your soul
Say goodbye my love
Thought that I could make you whole
Let your lover sail
Death was made to fail

Babe I know love is a funny thing
Born to die in the eternal spring

Your flickering is more than just a small flame
Welcome to the party, it's a ball game
Pick up the stick it's time to get hit with
Ayo ayo ayo ayo my bat

Suicide is never going to save you
When I cried, it was because I came to
You are the one I want to know right now
Ayo ayo ayo ayo kiss this



Sick Love - The Getaway - 2016

[Verse 1]
Say goodbye to Oz and everything you own
California dreamin' is a Pettibon
LA's screaming you're my home
Vanity is blasted but it's rarely fair
I could smell the Prozac in your pretty hair
Got a lot of friends, but is anyone there

[Refrain]
I don't know but it's been said
Your heart is stronger than your head
And this location is my home

[Verse 2]
Stick n move you're living in a quick world
Got a heavy laugh for such a tiny girl
Born into it that's for sure

[Chorus]
Rivers get connected so much stronger than expected well
Sick love comes to wash us away
Prisons of perspective
How your vision gets corrected and
Sick love is my modern cliche

[Verse 3]
People talk and tell you what you want to hear
Do you really need another souvenir
Superheroes tend to disappear
Fame is just a trick you see an empty glass
Leave you feeling thirsty and so very fast
Chase your tail my baby it'll be your last

[Refrain]
I don't know but it's been said
Your heart is stronger than your head
And this location is my home

[Chorus]
Rivers get connected so much stronger than expected well
Sick love comes to wash us away
Prisons of perspective
How your vision gets corrected and
Sick love is my modern cliche

[Chorus]
Rivers get connected so much stronger than expected well
Sick love comes to wash us away
Prisons of perspective
How your vision gets corrected and
Sick love is my modern cliche

[Outro]
Openly defective is the lover you elected and
A portrait she was bound to portray



Go Robot - The Getaway - 2016

[Verse 1]
I called the teacher cause I wanted to confess it now
Can I make the time for me to come and get it blessed somehow
She spoke to me in such a simple and decisive tone
Her sweet admission left me feeling in position from

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I don't take these things so personal
Anymore, anymore
I don't think it's irreversible
Anymore

[Verse 2]
Somebody hooted and they hollered can I buy a vowel
Don't let her catch you in the act of throwing in the towel
And when it's not as it appears to be, the flagrant foul
Can I put my fingers in your mouth before you start to growl

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I don't think that it's so terrible
Anymore, anymore
I don't think that it's unbearable
Anymore

[Chorus]
Tell me now, I know that it just won't stop
You will find your flow when you go robot
I want to thank you and spank you upon your silver skin
Robots don't care where I've been
You've got to choose it to use it, so let me plug it in
Robots are my next of kin

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I feel like I'm a sentimental trooper
She cried so hard, you know she looked like Alice Cooper

[Pre-Chorus 3]
I don't think that it's so personal
Anymore, anymore
I don't think it's irreversible
Anymore

[Chorus]
Tell me now, I know that it just won't stop
You will find your flow when you go robot
I want to thank you and spank you upon your silver skin
Robots don't care where I've been
You've got to choose it to use it, so let me plug it in
Robots are my next of kin

[Verse 4]
I'm kissing high and low
Our bodies like two dominoes
Can I come and get you when I hit you in your party clothes
Let's turn this cosplay holiday, what we obey
And now we're welcoming each other to this cabaret

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I don't think that it's so terrible
Anymore, anymore
I don't think that it's unbearable
Anymore

[Chorus]
Tell me now, I know that it just won't stop
You will find your flow when you go robot
I want to thank you and spank you upon your silver skin
Robots don't care where I've been
You've got to choose it to use it, so let me plug it in
Robots are my next of kin



Feasting on the Flowers - The Getaway - 2016

[Verse 1]
I was walking through the streets I could not hear my best friend call
He was feeling incomplete about to take his final fall
Last thing I remember there were tears of blood and just not mine
Any other day and I would save you from this cold decline

[Chorus]
Everything they said about everything
Was a coming undone it's a life supreme
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, Oh yeah

Feasting on the flowers so fast and young
It's a light so bright that I bite my tongue
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, Oh yeah
The next dimension, show me in

[Verse 2]
We were moving in the world, expanding your realities
A force of nature on the verge, commanding abnormalities
Last thing I remember there was ringing in my selfish ears
Twenty-Six a number much too small for someone's golden years

[Chorus]
Everything they said about everything
Was a coming undone it's a life supreme
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, Oh yeah

Feasting on the flowers so fast and young
It's a light so bright that I bite my tongue
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, Oh yeah
The next dimension, show me in

[Interlude]
You get a little bit more this time when
You give a little bit for your brother's kind
Like she always said, "Oh, Don't look back, just look ahead"

You sing a little bit stronger when you
Remember the song of your old best friend
Like she always said, "Oh, Don't look back, just look ahead"

[Chorus]
Everything they said about everything
Was a coming undone it's a life supreme
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, Oh yeah

Feasting on the flowers so fast and young
It's a light so bright that I bite my tongue
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, Oh yeah



Detroit - The Getaway - 2016

Find me in the suburbs and
The shadow of decay
Rolling rings of rubber and
The band begins to play

Am I on the right side of the left side of your brain
Can you see the rising of old yesterday's remains
Funkadelic said it best I think you know the rest
Time don't stand a chance against this motor madness

Don't you worry baby I'm like
Detroit, I'm crazy
Don't you worry baby I'm like
Detroit, I'm crazy I'm like
Detroit, I'm crazy
Don't you worry baby I'm like

The Stooges and J Dilla, yeah
They tore this town apart
Put me back together, well
I guess that's quite an art

Henry won the war you see
But not with pen or sword
He did it with the little thing I think it's called a Ford

Funkadelic said it best I think you know the rest
Time don't stand a chance against this motor madness

Don't you worry baby I'm like
Detroit, I'm crazy
Don't you worry baby I'm like
Detroit, I'm crazy I'm like
Detroit, I'm crazy
Don't you worry baby I'm like
Detroit, I'm crazy I'm like
Detroit, I'm crazy

Everything's so hazy I'm like
Detroit, I'm crazy I'm like
Detroit, I'm crazy
Everything's so hazy



This Ticonderoga - The Getaway - 2016

I met a man in a rock and roll band he said won't you come with me
I let him know that I could not go you see I get mine for free

We are all just soldiers in this battlefield of life
One thing that's for certain is my burning appetite

Step inside the emotional ride I could use some company
Illusionary is so damn scary I call my best friend Flea

This Ticonderoga is an element that shines
Connected by the great unknown between us there are lines

Yes I told her that
I'm the older cat
Can I scratch your back all day
I would not have it any other way, well

Means so much to me
Can you see the we
What are we ever gonna do when all I want to be is next to you

I took a girl from the underworld and I held her way too tight
When it's all been said and done she was not up for the fight

We are all just soldiers in this open field of time
Hoping to get with you when you get right with your mind

It's my favorite
So I savor it
I must report that life is short
So of your love I'll take ten quarts well

There's no end to this
Don't pretend to miss
You and you would not repent for sitting on my elephant and

Am I crazy to
Join the lazy zoo
All these human butterflies and
Cactus flowers swollen eyes and

I want the devil's share
Of you I do declare
Again I'm asking can I do
When all these animals want to be just like you

I met a girl with long black hair and she opened up so wide
A daffodil growing in Brazil and I picked her for my bride

We are all just soldiers in this epic loving flight
And no one that I know has ever really done it right

Done it right
Done it right
Done it right
Done it right



Encore - The Getaway - 2016

[Verse 1]
Listen to The Beatles and the sound of laughing Ed McMahon, we got high
Educated by a world so full of self and lost in space, too much pride
Cosmonauts and dirty thoughts are juggling the juggernaut, Soviet Spy
Every now and then when I remember to befriend, the little things in life

[Chorus]
Hey you're fine
I wanna listen to the radio
Driving down Calexico highway
And now I know the signs for sure

Hold my hand
I want to share it all with Mary
Results are gonna vary now

[Verse 2]
Later on I'll read to you the things that I've been needing to say goodbye
Walk away from mom and dad to find the love you never had, tell no lies
Carry on and write a song that says it all and shows it off 'fore you die
Take a little breath before you catch an early death there is so much sky

[Chorus]
Hey you're fine
I wanna listen to the radio
Driving down Calexico highway
And now I know the signs for sure

Hold my hand
I want to share it all with Mary
Results are gonna vary now

[Bridge]
Skinny brains and little stains upon your
Face teenage remains tell me more
Lifted in the Fifties when you really rather drifted through time, let's soar

[Chorus]
Hey you're fine
I wanna listen to the radio
Driving down Calexico highway
And now I know the signs, for sure, for sure

Hold my hand
I want to share it all with Mary
Results are gonna vary now



The Hunter - The Getaway - 2016

[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning like I always do
I still like to think that I'm new
Time just gets its way
Strawberries left to decay

Can't find my pants or my bank account
Don't you slip away
Voices that start to betray

[Chorus]
Even though you raised me I will never be your father
King of each and every Sunset Marquis
Even though you're crazy you will never be a bother
You're my Old Man In the Sea

[Verse 2]
I still like to laugh when I make a joke
I still like to think that there's hope
Time just has its say
Strawberries left to decay

Struck by the sight of an empty hall
Don't you fade away
Voices that start to betray

[Chorus]
Even though you raised me I will never be your father
King of each and every Sunset Marquis
Even though you're crazy you will never be a bother
You're my Old Man In the Sea

[Bridge]
The hunter gets hunted
We all get confronted
Don't just slip away
Voices that start to betray

[Chorus]
Even though you raised me I will never be your father
King of each and every Sunset Marquis
Even though you're crazy you will never be a bother
You're my Old Man In the Sea



Dreams of a Samurai - The Getaway - 2016

Standing naked in your kitchen
Feeling free that I could be alive
Clearly I'm a contradiction
Too young to be my wife

A peaceful storm is never hectic
Her mellow voice that I could be within
The uniform is anorexic
A jealous choice won't win

A metamorphosis samurai
Y'got a little lord fish and I don't know why I got a
Metamorphosis samurai

Paint your face cause I'm a black foot
I thought I counted up the fireflies
Close enough to get a good look
Time to mobilize

A metamorphosis samurai
Y'got a little lord fish and I don't know why I got a
Metamorphosis samurai

I'm a lonely lad
I've lost myself out on the range
I don't remember much
So don't ask me I've gone insane

Taking acid in a graveyard
Stealing food to keep the night alive
Every day I try to play hard
Even with my lies

The day they found you on a tour bus
The news was barren as a desert bone
The tabloids made a kind of small fuss
A couple pictures shown

I'm a lonely lad
I've lost myself out on the range
I don't remember much
So don't ask me I've gone insane

Slowly turning into driftwood
No one ever wants to die alone
Thinking that a pretty gift could
Make you less unknown

Dirty sneakers on the pavement
The brilliant features of a common man
See the miracle of your life
No one ever can

I'm a lonely lad
I've lost myself out on the range
I don't remember much
So don't ask me I've gone insane

See the world go by
The changes that we entertain
I don't recall it all
Remember I have gone insane
